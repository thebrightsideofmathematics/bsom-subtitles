00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,720
Hello and welcome to this

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:06,480
video about the election system for

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,080
the "Bundestagswahl 2025".

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,559
Mainly, I want to explain

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,599
how the German parliament (Bundestag)

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,400
is put together after each voter

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,800
has given his two votes (There are Erststimme and Zweitstimme)

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,480
Often one says that the whole

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
election system is really

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,039
complicated since it is adapted again and again.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,080
However, in this video

12
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,080
you will see that the entire 

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,599
distribution procedure is actually

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,400
quite simple and the first thing to

15
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,920
remember is that the whole

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,559
election prodecure essentially has three

17
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,600
layers. On the outermost layer,

18
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,320
we have the entire federal republic of

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,640
Germany. This defines the electoral area.

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,360
But it is split, on the one hand,

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,640
into 16 states. And the other hand

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,480
it is split into 299 electoral districts (Wahlkreise)

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,559
There, it is important to know that a Wahlkreis

24
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,800
always lies completely inside a

25
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:57,079
given state. Then these districts are

26
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,399
enumerated from 1-299.

27
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:03,040
For example for the state Hessia

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,799
we find the numbers 166 to

29
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,479
187. And it's important to know that

30
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,080
in each district, the given ballot paper

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,680
looks different. In that sense, voting

32
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,720
happens on the layer of the electoral districts.

33
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,200
If we pick out one of them,

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,000
then we see that within the

35
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,560
given Wahlkreis, so-called constituency candidates (Wahlkreisbewerber)

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,720
compete against each other.

37
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,960
They are also called "direct candidates" because

38
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,759
one can vote for them directly, as a vote for a person.

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,600
That is exactly what you can do with your first vote.

40
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:35,600
This is one is called "Erststimme".

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,479
Your own Erstimme, which you can use,

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,200
is only applicable in the given

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,439
electoral district. On the other hand, your second vote,

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,079
the so-called "Zweitstimme" is stronger.

45
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,079
It's applicable to the whole state you are living in.

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,200
However, with this Zweitstimme you do not vote for a single person anymore

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,880
but for a whole list of people

48
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,520
that is given by a political party.

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,200
This means each party in a given state 

50
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,960
can state a whole list of candidates

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,960
and the voter can use his Zweitstimme

52
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,159
to say which party he wants.

53
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,039
In the following sense,

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,599
the Zweitstimme is stronger than the Erststimme

55
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,360
because the total number of votes in the Zweitstimme

56
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,920
determine the proportions of the parties 

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,080
in the Bundestag.

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,360
So, only the Zweitstimme says

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,120
how many seats a party has in the parliament.

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,959
However, the people who can actually take the seats with priority

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,599
are the winners in the electoral districts.

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,480
It's common that these candidates are

63
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,480
associated to political party as well.

64
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,760
This is not

65
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,360
a strong requirement but

66
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,120
it's still the normal case.

67
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,519
In exceptional cases, it can happen

68
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,360
that an independent candidate

69
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,239
wins a given district.

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,319
In this case, this independent person immediately gets their seat in

71
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,080
the Bundestag. Everything that follows now does not hold for this person.

72
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,040
The winners that

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,159
are associated to a party

74
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,519
don't get their seats immediately.

75
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,000
For them, it's important

76
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,319
how many votes their part got with the Zweitstimme.

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,920
To make it clear again:

78
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,920
The winner of a district

79
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,080
is just the candidate that got the most

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,760
votes with the Erststimme.

81
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,319
So their is exactly one winner for each district.

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,920
However, if this winner associated to a party

83
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,159
really gets a seat in the parliament

84
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,640
is only decided by the amount of votes 

85
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,840
in the Zweitstimme.

86
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,159
Let's see how this works. After the election

87
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,040
we have the total number of valid votes in the Zweitstimmme.

88
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:27,519
This is done on the upper level, for the entire federation.

89
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,239
A common number in Germany is around 46 million votes.

90
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,040
And since the Zweitstimme can only be given

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,040
to a party,

92
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,680
we have a distribution of votes across all parties

93
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,799
that took part in the election.

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,319
So we just count the votes (Zweitstimmen)

95
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,840
and then we know how well a given

96
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,360
party has done.

97
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,480
Obviously, we can write this 

98
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,879
as a percentage as well. 

99
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,599
So we have the share of votes in relation 

100
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,040
to the total number of valid votes.

101
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,920
On the other hand, we can also look

102
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,159
how successful the parties

103
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,000
were with respect to the Erststimme

104
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:01,640
This means how many of the 299 districts

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,120
they could win.

106
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,200
This is really important because now

107
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,120
it will be decided which party is

108
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,120
important enough for the Bundestag.

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,239
Unimportant are parties with less than 5% of the total second votes.

110
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,359
They will be thrown out completely unless

111
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,639
they have won at least three districts

112
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,479
with the Erststimme. In that case, they are spared.

113
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,800
So first check the 5% barrier and, if they are below, then check

114
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:29,240
how many districts are won.

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,840
For example, here 4.8% is not enough.

116
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,400
and two districts are also too little.

117
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,320
After these cancellations,

118
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,120
only some parties remain and exactly these

119
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,080
will get the seats in the parliament.

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,440
So we just have to find the correct number

121
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,960
and this is done with the so-called

122
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,440
Sainte-LaguÃ« method/ Webster method.

123
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,039
I have a separate video for that

124
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,720
if you are interested in it.

125
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,800
Here, we can just apply it

126
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,560
and it's only important to know

127
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,560
that the total number of seats in the Bundestag

128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,800
is given by 630.

129
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,000
So with all the votes in Germany,

130
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,960
we find the suitable distribution of seats.

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,199
This distribution for the different parties is called "Oberverteilung".

132
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,360
It already tells out the power of different parties

133
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,680
in the parliament.

134
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,759
However, we already know that

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,400
we need to put in more

136
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,160
because the votes (Zweitstimmen) were given

137
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,400
to a list in a state.

138
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,600
Hence, in the next step, we have to distribute

139
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,680
the seats to the 16 states.

140
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,440
This can be done for each party separately

141
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,240
since we know how many votes

142
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,360
each party got in each state.

143
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,560
Therefore, we just create a new list 

144
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,919
where all 16 states are listed

145
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,360
with the corresponding number of votes

146
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,639
for the given party.

147
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,960
To this list, the Sainte-LaguÃ« method is applied again.

148
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,680
Afterwards, each party knows

149
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,240
how many seats for each state

150
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,319
they get in the Bundestag.

151
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,840
Just to clarify: this second distribution

152
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,759
is often called "Unterverteilung".

153
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,800
This distribution has to be calculated

154
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,400
for each (important) party.

155
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,840
With that, we also know the people who

156
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,120
will occupy the seats.

157
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,759
In order to see this, let's jump

158
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,720
to one state, let's say that this

159
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,720
is state 2 and we consider the party B.

160
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,440
So, we know that 8 seats can be given.

161
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,240
Please recall that, from the beginning,

162
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,199
the parties had lists of people in the states.

163
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,520
Indeed, this state list of the 

164
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,599
given party is numbered consecutively

165
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,960
such that we can got step by step

166
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,880
to give the seats to different persons.

167
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,960
We can do this until all seats

168
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,160
are taken. However, actually some other people

169
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,680
have a higher priority first.

170
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,680
They are put on top of the list.

171
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,199
These are exactly the winners of the districts

172
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,000
that belong to the given state and party.

173
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,840
So people with the most votes (Erststimmen) in a district

174
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,759
are higher ranked than the state list.

175
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,639
Obviously, we only consider winners

176
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,440
that belong to party B. With that we 

177
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,479
can order the whole list.

178
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,919
On top, we have the best winner. So the candidate that had the 

179
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,560
highest percentage value in votes (Erststimmen).

180
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,479
Then comes the candidate with the next highest score.

181
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,120
And then it just goes on like this.

182
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,280
The list of priorities is done

183
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,520
and we can allocate the 8 seats.

184
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,639
At this point, you should see

185
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,360
that we have exactly 3 possibilities.

186
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,120
Let's start with the best case.

187
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,360
There, all winners of the districts

188
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,280
take seats in the Bundestag.

189
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,479
And maybe also the first persons on the state list get seats.

190
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,960
In this case, it does not matter at all 

191
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,240
how good a winner in a district actually was.

192
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,560
However, if there are too many winners 

193
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,800
of the given party,

194
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,759
then it can definitely play an important role.

195
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,120
In this case, the worst winners

196
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,520
will not get a seat in the Bundestag.

197
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,520
There are simply not enough seats for the party

198
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,800
and in this case, the state list is also 

199
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,039
untouched.

200
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,160
Now, the third case is something that

201
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,960
actually should never happen, but theoretically, it's possible.

202
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,720
It could happen that the state list

203
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,159
is too short, meaning that the party

204
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,319
did not find enough people to put on the list

205
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:54,120
and now they can't fill all their seats.

206
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,400
Therefore, these seats will just stay empty

207
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,599
and they remain unoccupied in the Bundestag

208
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,639
Hence, only if such a case occurs,

209
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,639
can the total number of seats

210
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,039
in the parliament be smaller than 630.

211
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,800
In fact, on the other hand, there is still

212
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:11,120
a special case that the total number is greater

213
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,879
than the planned 630.

214
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,720
This can only happen if a party

215
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,599
get more than 50% of the 

216
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,599
relevant second votes (Zweitstimmen).

217
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,680
Then this party must get more than

218
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,360
50% of the seats in the parliament. 

219
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,400
Because of rounding errors

220
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,120
during the distribution procedure,

221
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,520
this is not guaranteed. 

222
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,680
Hence, one has to add seats until 

223
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,320
until 50% are exceeded.

224
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,800
For the election 2025 this is not expected.

225
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,959
I now hope that this voting procedure is clearer and

226
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,640
that there will be no more confusion

227
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:43,959
when you have the ballot paper in front of you.

228
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,880
Otherwise we can discuss further 

229
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:48,240
questions in the comments.

230
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,380
See you next time.

231
00:08:48,240 --> 00:09:00,560
Bye!
