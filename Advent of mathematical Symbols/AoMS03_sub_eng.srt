The mathematical symbol for today is the Nabla symbol.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,395
Which is written as this triangle.

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:11,929
It often occurs when you do vector analysis or multivariable calculus.

4
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:17,336
Because there it can be used as an operator, which acts on functions.

5
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:24,733
The definition is not so complicated. It's just a vector, where the components are given by derivatives.

6
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:29,421
So first we have the partial derivative with respect to the first variable

7
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:31,000
Maybe it's called "x_1".

8
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:36,695
Then the second component would be the partial derivative with respect to the second variable. 

9
00:00:37,257 --> 00:00:41,728
Of course if you work in 3 dimensions, it ends with the third variable here.

10
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:51,536
However in general, of course with n dimensions we just have n components and we end with the partial derivative with respect to the last variable.

11
00:00:52,257 --> 00:01:00,377
So what you should see here is, this is simply a short way to put all the partial derivatives, with first order into one object.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,857
Then formally you can calculate with this object we call Nabla, like it would be a normal vector.

13
00:01:08,557 --> 00:01:13,464
For example if we have the function that has two variable "x_1" and "x_2".

14
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:18,280
and now assume the function is just defined by "x_1" cubed.

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,879
Then we can calculate the so called gradient of "f".

16
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:27,412
There we would write it as nabla f(x_1, x_2).

17
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,043
Which in this case is a vector with two components.

18
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:35,806
In the first one we find the partial derivative with respect to x_1

19
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:38,769
Which means we have 3*x_1 squared.

20
00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:43,586
and in the second component we have the partial derivative with respect to x_2

21
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:45,057
Which is 0.

22
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:48,196
Ok, so this is the Nambla symbol.

23
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:51,112
also often called the nabla operator.

24
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:52,607
Thanks for listening.
