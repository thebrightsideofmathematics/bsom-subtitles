00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,705
 Hello and welcome to a new

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:04,685
 video about measure theory.

3
00:00:05,425 --> 00:00:07,081
 First, let me thank all the

4
00:00:07,113 --> 00:00:08,969
 nice people who support this

5
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:10,565
 channel on Steady.

6
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:12,777
 Today's video is about

7
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:14,617
 Carathéodory's extension

8
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,525
 theorem.

9
00:00:16,345 --> 00:00:17,881
 Okay, so this is a video

10
00:00:17,953 --> 00:00:19,537
 in my measure theory

11
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:20,169
 series.

12
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:21,977
 But you don't have to know

13
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:23,673
 all the videos there

14
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:25,297
 for understanding

15
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,173
 Carathéodory's extension theorem.

16
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:28,717
 It's sufficient when you

17
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:30,717
 know what a measure is

18
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,949
 and what a sigma algebra

19
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:32,585
 is.

20
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:34,421
 All the other notions we

21
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:36,293
 need I will explain here

22
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:36,945
 today.

23
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:39,429
 So let's start immediately

24
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:40,745
 with the theorem.

25
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:42,605
 As always, we have a set

26
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:44,573
 X and we also look at

27
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,389
 subsets of the set

28
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:46,741
 X.

29
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,245
 So we look at a collection

30
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:50,173
 of these subsets and we always

31
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:51,845
 call this by this curved

32
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:52,545
 A.

33
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:55,671
 In general, this is not

34
00:00:55,743 --> 00:00:57,655
 a sigma algebra now, but

35
00:00:57,735 --> 00:00:59,207
 only a so called

36
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,395
 semi ring.

37
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:03,487
 To be more specific, I will

38
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:05,199
 call it a semi ring of

39
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:05,983
 sets.

40
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,335
 Then you know that we are

41
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,367
 talking about a collection

42
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:09,315
 of sets.

43
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:11,543
 The explicit definition of

44
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:13,175
 a semi ring I will give you

45
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:13,795
 later.

46
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:15,751
 However, in the same way

47
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:17,247
 as for the sigma algebras,

48
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:19,267
 we also have a map

49
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:20,695
 we call mu

50
00:01:21,075 --> 00:01:22,643
 defined on

51
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:24,707
 the whole collection of subsets.

52
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:26,331
 So on this semi ring

53
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:28,219
 here, and it maps into

54
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:29,635
 the non negative real

55
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,075
 numbers where we

56
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:32,899
 include infinity

57
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,135
 as a symbol.

58
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:34,971
 Okay.

59
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:36,611
 In the case that A is not

60
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:38,531
 a sigma algebra, this can't

61
00:01:38,563 --> 00:01:39,815
 be a measure.

62
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:41,371
 And therefore there is another

63
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:42,595
 name for such a thing.

64
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:44,027
 We call it a pre

65
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:44,815
 measure.

66
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:46,917
 Of course, this name tells

67
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:47,845
 you a lot.

68
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:49,829
 It's a map that you

69
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,685
 define before you can

70
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,585
 define a real measure.

71
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:55,525
 Okay, I will tell you more

72
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:56,589
 about this later.

73
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,541
 First let us focus on the

74
00:01:58,573 --> 00:01:59,585
 theorem here.

75
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:01,265
 The first claim.

76
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:03,485
 Obviously you have an

77
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:04,425
 extension,

78
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:06,505
 then mu

79
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:08,021
 has an

80
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:08,985
 extension

81
00:02:10,894 --> 00:02:11,910
 and we call this

82
00:02:11,982 --> 00:02:13,774
 extension by

83
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,062
 mu tilde.

84
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:16,774
 And indeed this is an

85
00:02:16,814 --> 00:02:18,790
 ordinary measure as we already

86
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:19,674
 know it.

87
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:21,934
 Therefore it really needs

88
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:23,878
 a sigma algebra as

89
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:24,846
 its domain.

90
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,278
 So we call this

91
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:27,734
 sigma of

92
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,434
 A.

93
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:30,430
 Please remember this one

94
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:32,214
 is just a short notation

95
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:34,190
 for the sigma algebra that

96
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:35,678
 is generated by the

97
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:37,407
 subsets that are elements

98
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:38,315
 in A.

99
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:39,935
 And of course we have to

100
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:41,463
 land again in our

101
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,431
 interval 0 to infinity,

102
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:45,195
 where we include infinity.

103
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:47,583
 Hence the claim of the theorem

104
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,415
 is if you have these

105
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:51,311
 things, you get out an

106
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:52,535
 actual measure.

107
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:54,487
 And extension now just

108
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:56,391
 means that if you look at

109
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:58,255
 the original subsets in

110
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,239
 A, it does not matter if

111
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,687
 you measure it with mu or

112
00:03:01,711 --> 00:03:02,755
 mu tilde.

113
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:06,731
 So the new measure is

114
00:03:06,763 --> 00:03:08,547
 indeed bigger or better

115
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:10,375
 than the pre measure before,

116
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:12,299
 but you don't change the

117
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:13,695
 original values.

118
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:16,539
 Okay, so this was part

119
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:18,603
 a, which tells you that

120
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,403
 there is an extension.

121
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,259
 So this is an existence

122
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:22,975
 result.

123
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:24,651
 However it would be also

124
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:26,227
 Nice to have a uniqueness

125
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,579
 result as well.

126
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:28,819
 And this is what we will

127
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:30,121
 have in part b.

128
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:32,221
 Now however, we

129
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,157
 need some additional condition

130
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:34,825
 here.

131
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:36,789
 This condition is often

132
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:37,997
 called sigma

133
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:39,061
 finite.

134
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,157
 It means that you find a

135
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,149
 sequence of subsets,

136
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:45,305
 let's call them SJ

137
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,157
 such that

138
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:49,269
 SJ is in our

139
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:50,301
 semi ring.

140
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:51,585
 So in A

141
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:54,157
 they should also cover the

142
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:54,981
 whole set.

143
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:56,305
 So the union

144
00:03:56,835 --> 00:03:58,435
 J starting with one

145
00:03:58,595 --> 00:03:59,615
 going to

146
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:00,975
 infinity

147
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,563
 is equal to

148
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,215
 X.

149
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:08,139
 And in addition, all the

150
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:09,603
 sets should have

151
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:11,535
 finite pre measure.

152
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,379
 This means that if we put

153
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,403
 the set into the function

154
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,307
 mu, we get out a

155
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:18,803
 finite number, so not

156
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,055
 infinity here.

157
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:23,820
 Now, if we have all these

158
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:25,644
 things, then the

159
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:27,308
 conclusion is that this

160
00:04:27,356 --> 00:04:28,916
 extension is also

161
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,784
 unique.

162
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:31,652
 Now this means that we can

163
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,564
 summarize Carathéodory's

164
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:35,104
 theorem in the following.

165
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:37,268
 If we have a pre

166
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:38,924
 measure that fulfills

167
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:40,580
 this condition here,

168
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:42,476
 then there is exactly

169
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,132
 one extension

170
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:46,068
 to the sigma

171
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:47,706
 algebra that is generated

172
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,595
 by this semi ring.

173
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:51,911
 So exactly one

174
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:52,755
 measure.

175
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:54,871
 Moreover, this property

176
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:56,735
 then also holds for

177
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:58,155
 our mu tilde.

178
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:00,431
 Mu tilde is also

179
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,875
 sigma finite.

180
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,007
 If you never heard this notion

181
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,407
 sigma finite, that's not

182
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,223
 a problem.

183
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,271
 Definition is here and you

184
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:09,767
 should recognize it's a

185
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,775
 generalization of a finite

186
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:12,535
 measure.

187
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:14,569
 For a finite measure, the

188
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:16,193
 measure of X would be

189
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,073
 finite, and this then

190
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,405
 still holds.

191
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:21,281
 But if it's not finite,

192
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:23,065
 then sigma finite

193
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:24,761
 then tells you you can

194
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,625
 approximate the whole

195
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:28,265
 set with finite

196
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:29,765
 measured sets

197
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,561
 and you only need countable

198
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,805
 many of them.

199
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:36,321
 However, don't worry, you

200
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:37,857
 will see in other videos

201
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:39,441
 why this will be important

202
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:40,365
 in future.

203
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:42,271
 Well, there you have it.

204
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,935
 This is Carathéodory's

205
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:45,515
 extension theorem.

206
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,583
 There may be other variants

207
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,415
 of this theorem, but this

208
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:50,983
 version is the one I

209
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,195
 personally prefer.

210
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:55,263
 Now, as promised, I give

211
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,175
 you all the explanations

212
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:58,527
 you need for the notions

213
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:59,195
 here.

214
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:01,287
 After this I give you

215
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:03,055
 an example and also

216
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:04,415
 an application of the

217
00:06:04,455 --> 00:06:05,989
 theorem.

218
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,681
 But first, let's start with

219
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:08,885
 the semi ring.

220
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:12,617
 I called it a semi ring

221
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:13,745
 of sets.

222
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:15,777
 To remember you that we

223
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,681
 consider a subset

224
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,725
 in the power set of X.

225
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,385
 Now we need three properties

226
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:24,889
 such that we can call it

227
00:06:24,937 --> 00:06:26,045
 a semiring.

228
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:28,521
 The first property is that

229
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:30,281
 the empty set is in

230
00:06:30,313 --> 00:06:32,235
 all cases in the

231
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:33,015
 collection.

232
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:35,235
 If you remember the sigma

233
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:37,147
 algebra, you recognize this

234
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:38,987
 is the same thing we

235
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:40,539
 want from a sigma algebra

236
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:41,683
 at the beginning.

237
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,475
 The second property is now

238
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:44,923
 that we can form

239
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:46,215
 intersections.

240
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:48,195
 This means that the intersection

241
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:49,779
 of two sets in A

242
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:51,539
 lies also in

243
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:52,175
 A.

244
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:54,467
 Please also remember this

245
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:56,419
 is indeed satisfied for sigma

246
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:57,155
 algebras.

247
00:06:57,275 --> 00:06:58,475
 It's not in the definition,

248
00:06:58,595 --> 00:06:59,811
 but of course it follows

249
00:06:59,843 --> 00:07:00,975
 from the definition.

250
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:02,811
 However, please note that

251
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:04,555
 we don't say anything about

252
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:06,067
 complements or unions

253
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:06,643
 here.

254
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:08,475
 So Indeed, we weaken the

255
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,291
 notion of the sigma algebra

256
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:11,691
 with the notion of a semi

257
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,451
 ring.

258
00:07:12,643 --> 00:07:14,323
 But we have a third property

259
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:15,843
 where you will see a little

260
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:17,091
 bit of the unions and

261
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:17,935
 complements.

262
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:20,507
 It tells you that for arbitrary

263
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:21,855
 elements AB

264
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:24,379
 in A, you can

265
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:26,091
 look at the difference

266
00:07:26,243 --> 00:07:27,535
 of the sets.

267
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,131
 This one here is not the

268
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:31,771
 complement because we don't

269
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:33,755
 know if the set X is

270
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:35,123
 inside our semi ring.

271
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:36,395
 This does not follow from

272
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:37,855
 the two properties here.

273
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:39,923
 Nevertheless, we don't want

274
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,811
 that this difference is again

275
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:42,611
 in A.

276
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:44,331
 We just want that we can

277
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,339
 find a union of sets of

278
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:48,011
 A that is given

279
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:49,717
 as the difference here.

280
00:07:49,891 --> 00:07:51,481
 More concretely, this means

281
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:53,385
 there are pairwise

282
00:07:53,545 --> 00:07:54,565
 disjoint

283
00:07:56,665 --> 00:07:58,457
 sets and let's call

284
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:00,361
 them S1 till

285
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:02,169
 SN, so finitely

286
00:08:02,217 --> 00:08:02,805
 many.

287
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:05,145
 And they should lie in our

288
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,113
 semi ring A such

289
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:08,913
 that we can write this

290
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:10,849
 difference as the

291
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:12,721
 union of these

292
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,065
 pairwise disjoint

293
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:14,885
 sets.

294
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:17,571
 And this is then what we

295
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:19,403
 call a semi ring of

296
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:20,215
 sets.

297
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:21,971
 When you see this for the

298
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,923
 first time, it may look a

299
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,451
 little bit strange, but you

300
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:26,947
 will see later that this

301
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:28,935
 is exactly what we need

302
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:30,843
 for getting some intuition

303
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:31,627
 behind.

304
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,443
 Maybe.

305
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,371
 Let's look at an example

306
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,499
 and I call this one the

307
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:38,255
 most important example.

308
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:40,923
 This one is an example in

309
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:41,459
 R.

310
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,455
 So the real number line

311
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:45,797
 and we look at the finite

312
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,821
 intervals given by

313
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,773
 ab, where A

314
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,453
 is inside the interval but

315
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:53,065
 B is not.

316
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:55,701
 And for having a good interval

317
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:57,733
 I want A less or

318
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:59,345
 equal than B.

319
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,509
 Obviously this is not

320
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:03,945
 a sigma algebra.

321
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:06,469
 You can see this immediately

322
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:08,237
 because only the finite

323
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:10,195
 intervals are A.

324
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:12,911
 In particular, R

325
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:14,831
 itself is not in

326
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:15,435
 A.

327
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,343
 But we have to note

328
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,191
 that A generates a

329
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:23,047
 well known sigma algebra

330
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:24,887
 and this one is the Borel

331
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:25,991
 sigma algebra.

332
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:27,863
 So we can write in short,

333
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:29,759
 sigma of A

334
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:31,575
 is equal to

335
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:33,519
 Borel sigma algebra

336
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:34,635
 of R.

337
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:36,897
 This means that if we want

338
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:38,305
 to describe the Borel sigma

339
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,065
 algebra, it is sufficient

340
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:41,905
 to use these finite

341
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:42,725
 intervals.

342
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:44,873
 And the beautiful thing now

343
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:46,921
 is they form a semi

344
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,665
 ring, which

345
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:50,401
 means they can help us with

346
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:52,233
 Carathéodory's extension

347
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:53,125
 theorem.

348
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,345
 Ok, then let's check that.

349
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:56,753
 So let's check the three

350
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:57,565
 properties.

351
00:09:58,185 --> 00:09:59,849
 Of course the empty set

352
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:01,847
 is not a problem, it's

353
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:03,279
 formally given in this

354
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:04,935
 definition, but of course

355
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:06,455
 we always could put it in.

356
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:08,503
 But here, for a equals b,

357
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:09,935
 we have the empty set here

358
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:10,951
 because there's no point

359
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:12,035
 in the interval.

360
00:10:12,695 --> 00 :10:14,247
 So let's look at the second

361
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:15,271
 property here.

362
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:17,159
 It's about the intersection.

363
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:19,215
 So let's choose two intervals,

364
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:20,315
 maybe ab

365
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,119
 and also

366
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:23,275
 cd.

367
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:26,151
 Then it's easy to see what

368
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:27,751
 the intersection is if you

369
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:29,229
 just do a short

370
00:10:29,277 --> 00:10:30,105
 drawing.

371
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:33,125
 So here's the first interval

372
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:34,685
 a to b.

373
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:36,365
 And maybe the second one

374
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:37,613
 is now here.

375
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:39,677
 So c to

376
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:40,345
 d.

377
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:42,821
 Hence if this is the positions

378
00:10:42,853 --> 00:10:44,309
 of the intervals, then we

379
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,157
 immediately get out the empty

380
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:46,825
 set.

381
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:48,341
 And then you see, this is

382
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,061
 in the case when

383
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:52,245
 b is less or equal than

384
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:53,077
 c.

385
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:54,865
 Or the other way around,

386
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:57,131
 if d is less

387
00:10:57,203 --> 00:10:59,015
 or equal than a.

388
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:01,019
 Of course this is not so

389
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:01,659
 exciting.

390
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,283
 So maybe more

391
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,091
 interesting would be if

392
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,691
 the interval is

393
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:08,147
 inside the other interval.

394
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:10,139
 So maybe we shift

395
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:11,015
 that around.

396
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:13,307
 So there we

397
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:14,055
 have it.

398
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:17,851
 Now what comes out here is

399
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:19,571
 the interval that starts

400
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:21,109
 with c and ends with

401
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:21,745
 b.

402
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:23,837
 So let's put that in here.

403
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,701
 So I have c to

404
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:27,581
 b exactly in the

405
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:29,509
 case when my c

406
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:31,277
 lies inside

407
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:32,705
 interval ab,

408
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:35,117
 but d not.

409
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:36,661
 So I could write it in this

410
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:37,265
 way.

411
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:39,917
 Now you believe me that you

412
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:41,821
 get out the same or a similar

413
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:42,917
 result if you look at the

414
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,221
 symmetric case, so where

415
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:45,613
 the blue interval is on the

416
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:46,749
 right and the green intervals

417
00:11:46,797 --> 00:11:48,253
 on the left, so no problem

418
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:48,909
 there.

419
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:50,869
 And that you also get such

420
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,869
 an interval out if the interval

421
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:54,637
 lies completely inside the

422
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:55,465
 other one.

423
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:57,109
 Therefore I don't write this

424
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:57,749
 down.

425
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,645
 You note that we

426
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:01,365
 always get out

427
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:02,549
 such an interval.

428
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:04,549
 So an interval in A.

429
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:06,077
 So also this property

430
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:07,845
 holds and

431
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:09,025
 one holds.

432
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:10,861
 This means that we now have

433
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:12,601
 to check property three,

434
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,285
 the difference property.

435
00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:16,209
 Here we look now at

436
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:16,925
 ab

437
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:20,045
 without the set

438
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:22,005
 cd.

439
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,465
 Again here let's look at

440
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:25,361
 some cases.

441
00:12:25,473 --> 00:12:26,793
 So maybe the first one from

442
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:28,225
 before, where there's no

443
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:29,049
 intersection.

444
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:30,449
 Okay, then the difference

445
00:12:30,497 --> 00:12:30,905
 is clear.

446
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:32,605
 We don't subtract anything.

447
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:34,857
 The ab interval

448
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:35,725
 remains.

449
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:38,787
 Now in this case

450
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:40,727
 from here, you see, this

451
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:41,839
 is the intersection.

452
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,591
 So what remains is the

453
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:45,559
 interval from a to

454
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:46,195
 c.

455
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:48,639
 So let's write this down

456
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,687
 a to c, but c

457
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:52,515
 is not included.

458
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:54,831
 Okay, maybe we can ignore

459
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:56,367
 the other symmetric case.

460
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:57,927
 So when the blue interval

461
00:12:57,951 --> 00:12:59,327
 is on the right, then of

462
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:00,855
 course this interval would

463
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:02,515
 remain the right hand side.

464
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,255
 More interesting would be

465
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:06,675
 now another case

466
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:08,379
 where cd is

467
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:09,695
 inside ab.

468
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:12,059
 Of course for the intersection

469
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:13,379
 this was very boring.

470
00:13:13,507 --> 00:13:15,379
 But now something happens

471
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:16,095
 here.

472
00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:20,187
 Hence we subtract the middle

473
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:21,171
 part here.

474
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:23,091
 So what remains

475
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:24,615
 is this part

476
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:26,815
 and this part.

477
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:29,659
 In other words, this is a

478
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:30,899
 union of two

479
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:32,743
 intervals, namely

480
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,355
 a to c

481
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:36,375
 union with the

482
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,007
 interval d

483
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,195
 to b.

484
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:42,783
 But this is okay for a

485
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,623
 semi ring.

486
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:45,511
 We know we can have a union

487
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,407
 out of elements out

488
00:13:47,431 --> 00:13:48,275
 of A.

489
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:50,271
 Okay, ignoring

490
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:52,119
 renaming of the letters

491
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,967
 here, we know these are all

492
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:55,511
 the cases that can happen

493
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:57,555
 and therefore we are safe.

494
00:13:58,305 --> 00:13:59,925
 This is a semi ring.

495
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,417
 Okay, I hope this helped

496
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,241
 you a little bit about semi

497
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:04,889
 rings.

498
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:06,889
 And now we can talk about

499
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:08,825
 the next notion, which is

500
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:10,085
 the pre measure

501
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,009
 a premeasure is almost

502
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:13,769
 a measure.

503
00:14:13,857 --> 00:14:14,937
 That's the idea.

504
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,961
 But it's not defined on a

505
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:18,777
 sigma algebra, but just

506
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:20,393
 on such a semi ring

507
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:21,045
 A.

508
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:23,665
 Ignoring this fact, the

509
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:25,545
 definition looks almost the

510
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:27,549
 same, which means we have

511
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:28,557
 two conditions.

512
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,405
 And the first one is that

513
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:32,213
 the pre measure of the empty

514
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:34,077
 set as

515
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:35,029
 the measure of the empty

516
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:36,677
 set should always be

517
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:37,345
 zero.

518
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:40,365
 And the second property

519
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:41,877
 was the sigma

520
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:42,905
 additivity.

521
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:45,261
 This is what we can write

522
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:46,797
 as mu

523
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:48,665
 of a union,

524
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:50,661
 a countable union.

525
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:52,488
 So J from 1

526
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:54,099
 to infinity of

527
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,711
 sets AJ is

528
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:57,322
 equal to a

529
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,933
 series which starts

530
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,967
 also with 1 and goes

531
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:02,775
 to infinity, where we have

532
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:04,743
 inside the three measures

533
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,155
 of AJ.

534
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,431
 Now what we need are

535
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,143
 sets AJ

536
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:12,767
 from our curved 

537
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:13,511
 A.

538
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:15,635
 So from our semi ring.

539
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:17,375
 Of course, otherwise this

540
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:18,675
 does not make sense

541
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:20,993
 and there should be disjoint,

542
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,073
 which means

543
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:24,185
 AI intersected

544
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:25,697
 with aj

545
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,793
 is the empty set

546
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:28,685
 for

547
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:30,913
 I not equal

548
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:31,565
 j.

549
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:34,273
 Okay, so this was the definition

550
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:36,121
 or the sigma additivity for

551
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:37,645
 an ordinary measure.

552
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:39,769
 However, here it can't be

553
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:41,641
 true, because we

554
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:43,305
 have here the union

555
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:45,185
 of sets out of

556
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:45,901
 A.

557
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:47,853
 For sigma algebra this is

558
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:49,437
 not a problem, because in

559
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:50,549
 the definition of a sigma

560
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:52,341
 algebra we already know

561
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:54,301
 this is also in A.

562
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:56,381
 However, for semi ring we

563
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,301
 don't know this.

564
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,357
 We don't know if this union

565
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:01,305
 is inside A as well.

566
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:03,477
 But we need this if we want

567
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,421
 to put this one into the

568
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:07,197
 map mu and

569
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:09,005
 therefore we have to add

570
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:10,389
 this condition here.

571
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:12,175
 So we add that

572
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:13,687
 the union here

573
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:15,115
 is also

574
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:17,555
 in A.

575
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:19,847
 This means you should read

576
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:21,791
 (b) in this way for all

577
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:23,855
 sets AJ where this

578
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,159
 one and this one is

579
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:27,039
 fulfilled, this one

580
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,231
 here is also

581
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:29,195
 satisfied.

582
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,375
 And then we can call the

583
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:32,727
 map mu a pre

584
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:33,595
 measure.

585
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:37,255
 Now, for the end of this

586
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:39,049
 video, I want to give you

587
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:40,697
 an important application

588
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,409
 of Carathéodory's

589
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:43,845
 extension theorem.

590
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:46,217
 We have already seen

591
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:47,697
 that the finite

592
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:49,361
 intervals defined

593
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:50,685
 as ab

594
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:52,177
 where b is

595
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:54,113
 excluded form

596
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:55,857
 a semi ring of

597
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:56,685
 sets.

598
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,513
 Now we have no problem

599
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:01,585
 defining a pre measure,

600
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:03,521
 namely one that is defined

601
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:05,473
 on this finite

602
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,525
 intervals.

603
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:09,665
 What we can do is look at

604
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:11,521
 the length of the interval,

605
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,289
 which means our pre measure

606
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:15,129
 is defined as the

607
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:16,993
 difference between b

608
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:18,085
 and a.

609
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:20,305
 Now, it's not hard to see

610
00:17:20,385 --> 00:17:22,137
 that this is indeed a pre

611
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:22,793
 measure.

612
00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:24,497
 By this definition, you can

613
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:26,337
 immediately check these two

614
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:27,525
 properties here.

615
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:30,649
 And now we can apply

616
00:17:30,777 --> 00:17:32,225
 Carathéodory's

617
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:33,725
 extension theorem

618
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:35,393
 and know that there is

619
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:36,769
 exactly one

620
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:38,105
 extension for this

621
00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:39,165
 premeasure.

622
00:17:39,665 --> 00:17:41,225
 And this measure now

623
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:42,929
 lives on the sigma

624
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,417
 algebra that is generated

625
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,297
 by A, so generated by

626
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:48,121
 the finite intervals here.

627
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,673
 And we already know the sigma

628
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:50,601
 algebra.

629
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:52,145
 It's the Borel sigma

630
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:52,965
 algebra.

631
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:55,689
 Indeed, this is the measure

632
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:57,561
 that one knows as the

633
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:58,765
 Lebesgue measure.

634
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:00,747
 And here you see why

635
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:02,139
 Carathéodory's

636
00:18:02,187 --> 00:18:03,643
 theorem is so

637
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:04,371
 important.

638
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,115
 Because the Lebesgue measure

639
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:07,135
 is so important.

640
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,579
 And now by proving this

641
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:11,419
 extension theorem, we prove

642
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,435
 the existence and the uniqueness

643
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:14,975
 of the Lebesgue measure.

644
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:17,203
 Okay, there we have

645
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:17,707
 it.

646
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:18,963
 This was 

647
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,683
 Carathéodory's extension

648
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:21,615
 theorem.

649
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:23,827
 I really hope that this

650
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:25,875
 helped you a little bit understanding

651
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:26,495
 it.

652
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:28,625
 Of course, in other videos

653
00:18:28,665 --> 00:18:29,525
 in future

654
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:31,441
 applications for this

655
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:33,285
 theorem will follow.

656
00:18:33,705 --> 00:18:35,673
 And maybe we also talk about

657
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:37,085
 the proof later

658
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:39,305
 then thank you very much

659
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:41,145
 for listening and see you

660
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:41,965
 next time.

661
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:43,225
 Bye.
