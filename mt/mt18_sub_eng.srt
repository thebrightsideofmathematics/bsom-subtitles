00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:02,480
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,190
 a new video about measure

3
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:04,820
 theory.

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,099
 And first, I want to thank

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,939
 all the nice supporters on

6
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:09,449
 Steady

7
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:12,140
 extending the last video.

8
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:13,979
 I want to show you here an

9
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:15,979
 example of Cavalieri's

10
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:16,780
 principle.

11
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:19,159
 This should be a comprehensible

12
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:19,979
 example.

13
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:21,750
 And therefore we focus on

14
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,649
 the normal volume in

15
00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:24,350
 R three.

16
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,899
 The typical example can look

17
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:28,370
 like this, calculate the

18
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:30,360
 volume of the pyramid with

19
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,879
 the following corners.

20
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,400
 The word volume here

21
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,349
 means the Lebesgue measure

22
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,669
 on R³.

23
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,880
 And what you also learned

24
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:41,639
 in the last video is that

25
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,150
 you get this Lebesgue measure

26
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,540
 in R three by a

27
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,430
 product measure construction

28
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:48,439
 starting with the Lebesgue measure

29
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,139
 in R.

30
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,630
 However, before we talk about

31
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:53,080
 this, let's start by

32
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,830
 visualizing the pyramid with

33
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,869
 a short sketch

34
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:57,889
 Here,

35
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,360
 it's not hard to see that

36
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:00,209
 exactly this point

37
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,099
 (0,0,1) is

38
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,089
 the top of the pyramid and

39
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,760
 all the other points

40
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:07,580
 form the base, the

41
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:09,040
 square of the pyramid.

42
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,610
 In a formal way, the pyramid

43
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,129
 is given as a subset.

44
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,660
 And let's call it K

45
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,419
 in R three.

46
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,500
 By looking at our sketch,

47
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,010
 we are able to write

48
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,980
 down a formal definition

49
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:25,250
 of this set K.

50
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,250
 It's the set of all the points

51
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,510
 xyz in

52
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,330
 R three with the

53
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:33,129
 following conditions.

54
00:01:34,669 --> 00:01:36,459
 The first thing we see immediately

55
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,110
 is that Z lies

56
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,410
 between zero and one.

57
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:40,309
 So we can write

58
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,660
 zero less or equal

59
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,580
 than Z less or equal

60
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:45,209
 than one.

61
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,800
 You can also see that the

62
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:49,500
 possible values for X and

63
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,199
 Y depend

64
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,480
 on this X.

65
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,019
 Now, if you think about it,

66
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,900
 which functions describe

67
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,819
 these planes here, then you

68
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,300
 find that the short

69
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:02,059
 formulation is given by the

70
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:03,779
 absolute value is less or

71
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,599
 equal than one minus set.

72
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,480
 And the same for

73
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:08,020
 Y

74
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,190
 OK.

75
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,630
 I think here also another

76
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,470
 visualization is appropriate.

77
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,190
 Let's look at the pyramid

78
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,270
 from the top.

79
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:19,479
 Then we can see what happens

80
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,089
 to the X and Y values.

81
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,039
 And for the Z value, we use

82
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,160
 different colours.

83
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,339
 For example, here we have

84
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,850
 the square of the bottom

85
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:30,039
 which corresponds to the

86
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,910
 Z value equals to

87
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,470
 zero.

88
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,050
 This is what we call a level

89
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:35,669
 curve.

90
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:37,250
 However, if you look at an

91
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,100
 actual mountain and a map,

92
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,509
 you would call it a contour

93
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:40,919
 line.

94
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:43,800
 Now we can do this for different

95
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:44,320
 levels.

96
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,690
 For example, z

97
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,399
 equals

98
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,100
 1/4 would be

99
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,000
 this line here or this

100
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,779
 square and Z

101
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,570
 equals to one half

102
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,080
 would be this square.

103
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,110
 And in this picture at the

104
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,800
 top of the pyramid is

105
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:00,479
 just this point which

106
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,320
 corresponds to Z equals

107
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,990
 one, this

108
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,429
 nice picture now

109
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,229
 shows us what to do

110
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:09,630
 because we know how to

111
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,309
 calculate the measure of

112
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,029
 these squares here, which

113
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,460
 means the area of the

114
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,190
 squares.

115
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,270
 And then Cavalieri's

116
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,229
 principle tells us that

117
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,750
 we have to integrate

118
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,710
 all these

119
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,559
 measures to get

120
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,330
 the volume of the permit

121
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:25,660
 here.

122
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:27,889
 Or in other words, if we

123
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:29,789
 call our Lebesgue measure

124
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,720
 in our three mu,

125
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,520
 then we can use our product

126
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:36,259
 measure construction to

127
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,100
 write it as the product measure

128
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,000
 of MU one and mu

129
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:40,380
 two.

130
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,369
 Here mu one is the,

131
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,110
 the Lebesgue measure on R

132
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:46,740
 which means the z

133
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,649
 coordinate.

134
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:50,320
 And mu two is still a back

135
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,289
 measure on R two, which

136
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,169
 means the X and Y

137
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:55,570
 coordinate together.

138
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,279
 At this point, we can use

139
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:59,789
 Cavalieri's principle

140
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,910
 which tells us that the

141
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,750
 volume of the pyramid, which

142
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,399
 means mu of

143
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,860
 K is

144
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:07,949
 equal to the

145
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,490
 integral over

146
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,229
 R.

147
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:12,649
 This is the space where Mu

148
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,669
 one lives on.

149
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,169
 So we will integrate with

150
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:16,450
 respect to Mu one

151
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:19,118
 and we integrate the measures

152
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:21,079
 of these squares, which

153
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:22,218
 means mu

154
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,928
 two of the

155
00:04:23,938 --> 00:04:25,259
 squares and we call them

156
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:26,889
 M with index Z

157
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:27,799
 zero.

158
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,678
 And therefore we integrate

159
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:31,229
 over the variable Z

160
00:04:31,278 --> 00:04:31,908
 zero.

161
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,299
 Now, if you go back to the

162
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:36,160
 last video where I explained

163
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,970
 Cavalieri's principle, you

164
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,790
 see that MZ

165
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,670
 zero are sets

166
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,260
 that are defined in the

167
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:45,260
 space where mu two lives.

168
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:47,220
 In this means

169
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,070
 in this case, we only have

170
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,549
 now points with two

171
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,500
 variables X and

172
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,309
 Y in R two.

173
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,140
 These are the sections through

174
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:58,730
 the pyramid where z is

175
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,559
 fixed as z zero.

176
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,730
 Therefore, we only have these

177
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:04,529
 two conditions here with

178
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,929
 z zero on the right.

179
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,070
 And this defines, then

180
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,869
 our MZ zero.

181
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,799
 Now, you should recognize

182
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:15,440
 these are exactly the

183
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,279
 squares from before.

184
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,380
 Hence, it's no problem for

185
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,350
 us to calculate the area

186
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,559
 of such a square,

187
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,170
 the length of one side is

188
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:29,160
 given by two times

189
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,720
 one minus z zero.

190
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,829
 This is exactly the length

191
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,339
 we have in the X direction.

192
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,239
 And of course, it's the same

193
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,480
 in the Y direction.

194
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:39,309
 Therefore, we can write this

195
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,339
 as a square.

196
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,290
 Obviously, this only makes

197
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,079
 sense if our z

198
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:47,010
 zero is chosen

199
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,709
 between zero and one.

200
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,250
 So it lies in interval

201
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,339
 0 to 1.

202
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,730
 Of course, this is given

203
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:55,890
 in the definition of the

204
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:56,470
 pyramid.

205
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,230
 A point lies only in the

206
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,989
 pyramid if the Z value

207
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,790
 lies between zero and one.

208
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,790
 And this is also how we should

209
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,359
 read this equality

210
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:05,940
 here.

211
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,660
 It only makes sense for Z

212
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,850
 between zero and one.

213
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,820
 Otherwise we should define

214
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,779
 M zero Z zero as

215
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,549
 the empty set.

216
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:14,869
 OK.

217
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,350
 So no confusion here.

218
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,989
 What you usually would do

219
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,630
 is just write down

220
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:22,690
 the integral restricted to

221
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,670
 the interval

222
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:24,760
 01.

223
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,779
 And then we can copy the

224
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,440
 function here which is

225
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,100
 four times one

226
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:31,839
 minus Z zero

227
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,720
 squared

228
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,920
 and here d mu 1

229
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,839
 Z zero.

230
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:39,040
 Because this is just a

231
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,799
 normal one dimensional

232
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,410
 integral with respect to

233
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,160
 the Lebesgue measure, we can

234
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,730
 use a shorter notation.

235
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:47,859
 We write the integral from

236
00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:49,570
 0 to 1 copy

237
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:50,859
 again the function.

238
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,709
 And then we omit the measure

239
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,640
 D mu one and just write

240
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,350
 DZ zero

241
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,890
 to calculate this integral.

242
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:01,869
 You just need an antiderivative,

243
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,309
 which means here four

244
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,269
 times.

245
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,470
 And here we have

246
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:06,429
 minus

247
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,070
 1/3

248
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,769
 and one minus

249
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,359
 zero to the power of

250
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:11,910
 three.

251
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,260
 And the limits are

252
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:15,820
 zero and one,

253
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:18,619
 the upper part gives you

254
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,350
 zero.

255
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,160
 And the lower part here zero

256
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,750
 here gives you

257
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,390
 minus and minus.

258
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,470
 So plus

259
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,380
 4/3.

260
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,279
 And that's how you apply

261
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,730
 Cavalieri's principle.

262
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,570
 To calculate the volume

263
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,549
 of some body,

264
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,829
 you just look at it and then

265
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,649
 you think about how to

266
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,440
 section it such that you

267
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,209
 get out an integral that

268
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,010
 you can solve a

269
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,850
 good exercise would be now

270
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:48,690
 to do exactly the same

271
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,010
 thing and to

272
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,809
 calculate the volume of

273
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,730
 the sphere in R³.

274
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,459
 So please try this and

275
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,410
 after that, you are prepared

276
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,109
 to use Cavalieri's principle

277
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,440
 also in other

278
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,220
 situations.

279
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,869
 Well then thanks for

280
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,709
 listening and see you next

281
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,000
 time.

282
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,309
 Bye.
