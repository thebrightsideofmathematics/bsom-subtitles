00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,246
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,278 --> 00:00:03,358
 functional analysis.

3
00:00:03,454 --> 00:00:04,862
 First, big thanks to all

4
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:06,502
 the nice people who support

5
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,182
 my channel on Steady or

6
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:08,970
 Paypal.

7
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,942
 Now, this is part two of

8
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:12,566
 the series, and today we

9
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:14,006
 go deeper into the topic

10
00:00:14,038 --> 00:00:15,690
 of metric spaces.

11
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,886
 We've already learned if

12
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,662
 we have a set X and a

13
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,286
 metric for this set, then

14
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:22,878
 we call this a metric

15
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:23,530
 space.

16
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,894
 In a metric space, one can

17
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,478
 now generalize a lot of

18
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:28,982
 notions you may know from

19
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:30,530
 a real analysis course.

20
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,592
 For example, we can define

21
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:34,080
 sequences, limits,

22
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,456
 accumulation points, and

23
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:36,300
 so on.

24
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,088
 Of course, this is what we

25
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,980
 will use a lot in this series.

26
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,584
 However, before we do that,

27
00:00:42,672 --> 00:00:43,824
 let's talk about some

28
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:44,700
 examples.

29
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,144
 So let's start with a simple

30
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:48,912
 one, which is also one of

31
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:50,540
 the most important ones.

32
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,888
 The set is just the complex

33
00:00:52,944 --> 00:00:54,880
 numbers, and the metric should

34
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,624
 be the usual notion of

35
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:58,232
 measuring distances in the

36
00:00:58,256 --> 00:00:59,870
 complex numbers, which means

37
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,486
 its the absolute value where

38
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:02,566
 we look at the difference

39
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:03,770
 of both points.

40
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,198
 Now, the visualization in

41
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:07,926
 the complex plane gives us

42
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,798
 indeed the normal geometry

43
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:11,330
 we have in the plane.

44
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,654
 If we pick two complex numbers,

45
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:15,406
 x and y, we know we can

46
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:16,622
 calculate the difference,

47
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:18,530
 which is a new complex number.

48
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,486
 And the length of this new

49
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:22,326
 complex number is exactly

50
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:23,730
 the distance we want.

51
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,360
 Now, you know this normal

52
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,024
 geometry we have for measuring

53
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:29,824
 distances you can also do

54
00:01:29,912 --> 00:01:31,260
 in higher dimensions.

55
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,336
 For example, if the set is

56
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:35,184
 Rn, we would have a standard

57
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,992
 metric we can choose, and

58
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:38,456
 this is usually called the

59
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:39,952
 Euclidean metric or the

60
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,380
 euclidean distance.

61
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,584
 And because you know Pythagora's

62
00:01:43,632 --> 00:01:45,352
 theorem, you also know the

63
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:46,700
 definition of d.

64
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,632
 It's just the first component

65
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:50,432
 of x minus the first component

66
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:52,106
 of y squared,

67
00:01:52,258 --> 00:01:53,562
 plus the second

68
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:55,466
 component, and so

69
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,130
 on and so on, until you reach

70
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,402
 the last component, which

71
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:00,026
 is xn minus

72
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:01,950
 yn squared.

73
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,306
 And then, of course, we need

74
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:05,390
 the square root.

75
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,930
 Okay, so this is the euclidean

76
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,810
 metric, the common, but

77
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,482
 only a possible choice of

78
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,910
 a metric in Rn.

79
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,738
 So please remember, for a

80
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:16,050
 metric, we only need the

81
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,962
 three properties.

82
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:18,926
 It should be positive definite,

83
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:20,642
 symmetric, and fulfill the

84
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,190
 triangle inequality.

85
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,034
 We already know that these

86
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:25,914
 two fulfill the three properties.

87
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:27,698
 So there are metrics on

88
00:02:27,754 --> 00:02:29,630
 Rn or C respectively.

89
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,506
 So let's look at another

90
00:02:31,578 --> 00:02:32,602
 distance function we could

91
00:02:32,626 --> 00:02:33,954
 define for Rn.

92
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:35,378
 This would be the

93
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:36,390
 maximum,

94
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,954
 and then we look at the difference

95
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:40,842
 x one minus y

96
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:42,650
 one, and use the normal

97
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,400
 absolute value, or modulus

98
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,480
 in r.

99
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,060
 So let's write it down for

100
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,796
 all components, which means

101
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:51,652
 we want the maximum of

102
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:53,120
 all these differences.

103
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,260
 In fact, this is of course,

104
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,316
 a metric as well.

105
00:02:56,388 --> 00:02:57,588
 It's not hard to check that

106
00:02:57,604 --> 00:02:59,348
 it fulfills our three properties.

107
00:02:59,484 --> 00:03:00,860
 And most of the time, only

108
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,612
 the triangle inequality

109
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:04,080
 needs some work.

110
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,892
 However, we should first

111
00:03:05,956 --> 00:03:07,116
 visualize the whole thing,

112
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,840
 maybe again in the plane.

113
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,572
 So here we see two points,

114
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:11,348
 x and y.

115
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:12,540
 And what we now have to do

116
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,676
 is calculate the distances

117
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:15,400
 of the components here.

118
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,246
 Now in blue we have the distance

119
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:18,558
 in the first component and

120
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,190
 in green in the second component.

121
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,886
 And as you can see, the blue

122
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:22,918
 one is bigger.

123
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:24,542
 So the maximum is indeed

124
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:25,850
 this number here,

125
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,894
 which means using this

126
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,702
 metric, this is exactly the

127
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,358
 distance between x and y.

128
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:33,142
 Or in other words, if you

129
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,862
 choose a point z here, for

130
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:36,686
 example, it has the same

131
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,486
 distance from x than the

132
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,310
 distance x to

133
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,940
 y.

134
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,056
 Of course this shouldn't

135
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,008
 be so surprising.

136
00:03:43,104 --> 00:03:44,224
 Of course you could have

137
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:45,472
 different points that have

138
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:46,728
 the same distance from a

139
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:47,980
 chosen point x.

140
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,032
 In our Euclidean metric from

141
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:51,168
 above or in a picture in

142
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:52,472
 a complex plane, this would

143
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:54,080
 be just a circle

144
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,180
 around x.

145
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,920
 However, with another metric,

146
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,320
 such a thing we could call

147
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,160
 a circle might look completely

148
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,780
 different.

149
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,936
 Okay,

150
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:04,328
 So please keep that in mind

151
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:05,872
 whenever we use circles to

152
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:07,020
 visualize things.

153
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,216
 For our last example here,

154
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,576
 lets choose a more abstract

155
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:12,168
 one, just any set

156
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:13,728
 X which should not be the

157
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:14,540
 empty set.

158
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,992
 Then we define a metric

159
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:18,504
 by distinguishing two

160
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:19,140
 cases.

161
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,720
 The first case is just X

162
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,656
 is equal to y and the

163
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:25,592
 second, of course x is not

164
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:26,860
 equal to y.

165
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,776
 By the first property of

166
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:30,536
 the metric we already know

167
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:31,980
 here we need a zero.

168
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,266
 However, we are not allowed

169
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:35,938
 to have a zero here, so we

170
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:37,250
 can choose whatever we want.

171
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,594
 And most of the time we just

172
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:39,710
 choose one.

173
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,090
 Ok, so let's check together

174
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,110
 that this is indeed a metric.

175
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,010
 As it happens very often

176
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,442
 the first two properties

177
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:49,150
 are not a problem at all.

178
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,290
 Its positive definite by

179
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,290
 our construction.

180
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,870
 So no problem here.

181
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,026
 The second property is the

182
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:56,762
 symmetry.

183
00:04:56,906 --> 00:04:58,266
 And here you can see the

184
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,974
 whole definition is symmetric.

185
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:02,010
 So no problem here at all.

186
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,086
 The third property is the

187
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:05,662
 triangle inequality.

188
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,606
 And this one I want to

189
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:09,598
 write down in

190
00:05:09,614 --> 00:05:10,934
 order to show that we need

191
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:12,862
 three points, so x,

192
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:14,686
 y and z out of the set.

193
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:16,650
 And then we look at the inequality.

194
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,342
 This means that we go the

195
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:19,926
 detour over the point z.

196
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:21,766
 Or in other words, we add

197
00:05:21,798 --> 00:05:23,662
 the distances on the right.

198
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:25,286
 Okay, so this is what we

199
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:26,526
 have to show in general.

200
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:28,190
 So let's first look at two

201
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,210
 different cases.

202
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,966
 Now the first case would

203
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,510
 be x is equal to

204
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,454
 y because then we know

205
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,254
 the distance of x to y

206
00:05:36,342 --> 00:05:37,730
 is exactly zero.

207
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,742
 Okay, so let's write that

208
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,410
 here.

209
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,942
 This is zero.

210
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:42,774
 Okay.

211
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:44,670
 But then we know this inequality

212
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,102
 is correct because on the

213
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,798
 right hand side we just have

214
00:05:47,854 --> 00:05:49,678
 the metric or the distances

215
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:51,222
 and we already know they

216
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:52,662
 are positive or zero.

217
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,720
 In the worst case, this

218
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,064
 means that the triangle

219
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:57,744
 inequality in this first

220
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,500
 case is satisfied

221
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,912
 now, the second case of course,

222
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:03,016
 should be the opposite.

223
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:04,816
 So we have x is not equal

224
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:06,832
 to y, which means the distance

225
00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:08,760
 is by definition exactly

226
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,380
 one.

227
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,616
 Now, because we know that

228
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:13,312
 the only allowed distances

229
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,272
 are zero or one, there

230
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:16,448
 is nothing in between.

231
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:18,376
 We know that xz or

232
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:20,204
 zy have also

233
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,440
 one or zero.

234
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,900
 Or to put it in another way,

235
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,708
 we know that

236
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:26,280
 d(x,z)

237
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,284
 or the other one.

238
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,300
 So zy is

239
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,880
 also exactly one.

240
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,012
 At least one of them has

241
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:35,756
 to be one, otherwise both

242
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:37,356
 of them would be zero, which

243
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:38,700
 means that z is equal to

244
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,372
 x and z is equal to y.

245
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:42,076
 But then this would be not

246
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:43,160
 a second case.

247
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,580
 However, this means now,

248
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,180
 if we add both of these

249
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,156
 distances, we will get

250
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:49,676
 one.

251
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:50,916
 Or in the worst case, when

252
00:06:50,948 --> 00:06:51,972
 both of them are one, we

253
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:52,996
 get out two.

254
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:54,960
 So we have the inequality.

255
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,060
 So very good.

256
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,244
 Also in the second case,

257
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:00,236
 the triangle inequality is

258
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:01,120
 fulfilled.

259
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,620
 Well now, to close this example,

260
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,636
 let's recall that this definition

261
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:06,828
 defines a metric.

262
00:07:06,924 --> 00:07:08,748
 It works on any set, and

263
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:10,116
 it's called the discrete

264
00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:10,840
 metric.

265
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,228
 So you might try to visualize

266
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:14,454
 this metric space.

267
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:15,874
 It's a little bit strange

268
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,570
 because there are no neighbors

269
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,290
 around a given point, simply

270
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,754
 because theres a fixed

271
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:22,618
 distance from one point to

272
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:23,990
 all the other ones.

273
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,138
 This means that all the points

274
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:27,710
 are isolated points.

275
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,954
 Ok, so now we have a few

276
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:31,530
 examples of metric spaces

277
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,482
 we can work with.

278
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,346
 And in the next video I will

279
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:35,930
 talk about other objects

280
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,950
 we find in metric spaces.

281
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,386
 So thanks for listening and

282
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,570
 I hope I see you in the next

283
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,074
 video.

284
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:42,990
 Bye.
