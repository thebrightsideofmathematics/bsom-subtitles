00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:02,099
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:03,819
 functional analysis.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,699
 And first, I want to thank

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,860
 all the nice people that

5
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:08,420
 support this channel on Steady

6
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,220
 or paypal.

7
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,220
 This is the second part in

8
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:12,609
 our spectral theory.

9
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:13,729
 And we will talk about

10
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:14,869
 examples.

11
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:16,850
 The overall assumption here

12
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,170
 is that we have a complex

13
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,719
 Banach space X and a

14
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:21,239
 bounded linear operated

15
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:21,729
 T.

16
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,770
 For this, we define the set

17
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,489
 sigma T, the so-called

18
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,729
 spectrum of T.

19
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:29,049
 Now you already know lambda

20
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:30,850
 is an element of Sigma T

21
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,348
 if and only if

22
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,369
 T minus lambda

23
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,759
 identity is not

24
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,369
 invertible as a bounded

25
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,130
 operator.

26
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:39,810
 The first new thing I can

27
00:00:39,819 --> 00:00:41,029
 tell you today is that

28
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,830
 usually we will omit the

29
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,689
 identity in our notation.

30
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,529
 One can ignore the identity

31
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,259
 here because everyone knows

32
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,549
 what it should actually mean

33
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:51,700
 and we save space every time

34
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:53,180
 we use this expression.

35
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,139
 And of course, when we talk

36
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,590
 about the spectrum, this

37
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:58,540
 operator here occurs a lot.

38
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:59,330
 OK.

39
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,639
 Then let's go immediately

40
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,229
 to our first example.

41
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:03,840
 A good start would be to

42
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:05,769
 look at a simple finite dimensional

43
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:06,449
 example.

44
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,400
 Therefore, our Banach space

45
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,150
 X is then given by

46
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,019
 CN and

47
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:13,720
 our linear operator T should

48
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,160
 act on any vector

49
00:01:15,169 --> 00:01:16,589
 X like the

50
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,199
 diagonal matrix with

51
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:19,809
 entries lambda one, lambda

52
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,139
 two and so on, on the

53
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,819
 diagonal.

54
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:23,940
 In other words, the result

55
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:25,660
 of TX is simply the

56
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,389
 vector lambda one X

57
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,000
 one until lambda

58
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,059
 NXN.

59
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,139
 And here you see merely that

60
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,959
 the set lambda one to lambda

61
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,529
 N is exactly our

62
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,580
 spectrum of T.

63
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:38,370
 Now, please remember that

64
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:39,769
 we learned in the last video

65
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:41,059
 that in the finite dimensional

66
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,529
 case, all the points in the

67
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,440
 spectrum are eigenvalues.

68
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,489
 So the spectrum is equal

69
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,330
 to the so called point spectrum.

70
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,279
 Indeed, in this simple case

71
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,389
 here, we can immediately

72
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,209
 write down the eigenvectors.

73
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:54,730
 They are just given by the

74
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,559
 standard basis in CN.

75
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,610
 OK.

76
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,680
 I think that's enough, we

77
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,470
 can say in finite dimensions,

78
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,180
 the interesting things happen

79
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,709
 of course, in an infinite

80
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,569
 dimensional case for

81
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,150
 this, let's choose the LP

82
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,779
 space.

83
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:09,940
 We've already proven that

84
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,339
 this is a Banach space for

85
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,750
 P between one and

86
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,490
 infinity.

87
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,800
 So here you should see this

88
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:17,580
 is a straightforward generalization

89
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:18,699
 of our CN.

90
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,600
 The only difference is that

91
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,529
 a chosen vector X here does

92
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:23,500
 not have an end.

93
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,320
 Otherwise I want to have

94
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,910
 the operator T to do the

95
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,110
 same as before.

96
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,899
 Therefore, we could write

97
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,880
 this as a one sided infinite

98
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:32,820
 matrix.

99
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:34,800
 So you see this is the overall

100
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:36,619
 idea to find the generalization

101
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,889
 of the finite dimensional

102
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:39,039
 example from above.

103
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,830
 But of course, we really

104
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:42,750
 should state the formal definition

105
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,020
 of the operator T.

106
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,179
 So we take complex numbers

107
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,880
 lambda one lambda two and

108
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:49,830
 so on with the proper, that

109
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,809
 they form a bounded set.

110
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:53,960
 And this can be stated that

111
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,500
 the supreme of the absolute

112
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,279
 values is finite.

113
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,119
 With this, we then define

114
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,960
 T as a bounded linear

115
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,770
 operator from LP

116
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:03,889
 into LP

117
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:06,320
 simply by setting the J component

118
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,080
 of TX as lambda

119
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:09,869
 J times XJ.

120
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,929
 Of course, this fits in with

121
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,410
 our definition from above.

122
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,119
 But now you see we need this

123
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,619
 condition to get a bounded

124
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,279
 operator.

125
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,320
 OK.

126
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,240
 At this point, you should

127
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,830
 see what we did in the finite

128
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,600
 dimension example, still

129
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,369
 works in this infinite dimensional

130
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,039
 example.

131
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,350
 In particular, we find simple

132
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,100
 EIG vectors such that all

133
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,429
 these values are

134
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,289
 eigenvalues.

135
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,089
 So let's immediately write

136
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,880
 that down.

137
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,039
 For example, E one, the

138
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,740
 sequence

139
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,669
 100 and so

140
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,639
 on is an eigenvector

141
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:42,139
 corresponding to the eigen

142
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,039
 value lambda.

143
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,889
 One of course, in the

144
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:46,529
 same way we have a two

145
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:47,929
 with one at the second

146
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,690
 position as an eyeing vector

147
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:50,949
 with corresponding eigenvalue

148
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,130
 will you lambda two?

149
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,610
 Hence, you see we continue

150
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:55,899
 this for all our

151
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,660
 lambdas.

152
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:58,470
 Therefore, we have shown

153
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,429
 now that all these lambdas

154
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,130
 lie in the spectrum of tea.

155
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,559
 In other words, at least

156
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,910
 we have a subset relation

157
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,199
 here.

158
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:08,240
 On the other hand, we immediately

159
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,110
 see any other complex

160
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:12,050
 number can't be an eigenvalue

161
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:12,610
 of T.

162
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:15,089
 Therefore, this set is indeed

163
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,589
 the point spectrum of T.

164
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,690
 However, you already know

165
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,358
 this is in general not the

166
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:21,670
 whole spectrum of T.

167
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,570
 Indeed the important thing

168
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:24,690
 that could happen is that

169
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,329
 this set is actually

170
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,320
 infinite and then

171
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:30,049
 it has an accumulation point

172
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,160
 which is something that cannot

173
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,829
 happen in the finite dimensional

174
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,290
 case.

175
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,329
 OK.

176
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:36,799
 Then in the next step, let's

177
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,320
 consider such an accumulation

178
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:38,799
 point.

179
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:41,089
 So let you be a complex

180
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,519
 number with the property

181
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,519
 that it is not in the set

182
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:46,410
 itself but

183
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,929
 in the closure of the set,

184
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,059
 OK.

185
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,380
 Maybe an example is very

186
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,100
 helpful here.

187
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:52,529
 So it could happen that Lambda

188
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,399
 J is given as one

189
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,130
 over J, then the

190
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,579
 only possible accumulation

191
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,489
 point would be mu as

192
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,049
 zero.

193
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,970
 Hence, in this example, we

194
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,410
 would have our eigenvalues

195
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,600
 as one over J.

196
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:06,480
 So they tend to zero but

197
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:08,220
 zero itself is not an eye

198
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,850
 value.

199
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,880
 In fact, this is the general

200
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,570
 result T minus

201
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,109
 mu is always

202
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:14,920
 injective.

203
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,820
 Now, at this point, you might

204
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,329
 already guess in the next

205
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:19,529
 step, we want to show that

206
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,209
 this operator is not

207
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,929
 subjective.

208
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:23,910
 Now, with this result, we

209
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,910
 know that Mu is in the spectrum

210
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,640
 of T as well for

211
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:29,100
 showing this, let's use a

212
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,559
 proof by contradiction.

213
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,739
 Now assuming that the operator

214
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,709
 is surjective, then we know

215
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,230
 it's also by bijective.

216
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,109
 Please remember the injectivity

217
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,600
 was not a problem at

218
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:40,029
 all.

219
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,010
 OK?

220
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:42,859
 And now we can use the famous

221
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:44,670
 bounded inverse theorem to

222
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,269
 conclude that the inverse

223
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,029
 of our operator is also

224
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,709
 bounded.

225
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:50,730
 Knowing this, let's try

226
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:52,540
 calculating the corresponding

227
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:53,489
 operator norm.

228
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,329
 At least we know this is

229
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:56,769
 greater or equal

230
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,149
 than the norm.

231
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,089
 When we put in one of our

232
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,899
 e_js,

233
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:03,529
 please recall, this is just

234
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,970
 a sequence of zeros with

235
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,309
 the exception that at the

236
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,160
 J position there is a one

237
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,160
 for this reason, the acting

238
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,750
 of the inverse operator is

239
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,000
 easy to calculate.

240
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:14,880
 We just gave the inverse

241
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,619
 of the number lambda J

242
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,600
 minus mu.

243
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,829
 Also very simple is then

244
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,630
 calculating the P norm we

245
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,029
 just get the absolute value

246
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,869
 of this number.

247
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:25,170
 OK.

248
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,660
 And at this point, you should

249
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,760
 see a problem here.

250
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,179
 This estimate we have shown

251
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,149
 holds for all natural numbers

252
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,619
 J.

253
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,040
 And that's a problem because

254
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:36,619
 we know with the lambdas,

255
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,739
 we can get as close as we

256
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,549
 want to mu.

257
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,880
 In other words, the reciprocal

258
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,299
 here will explode

259
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,450
 or more formally, you can

260
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:46,989
 choose a subsequence of the

261
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,170
 natural numbers here.

262
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,660
 And then this sequence goes

263
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,480
 to infinity.

264
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:52,720
 So no matter how we put it,

265
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,600
 this number here can't be

266
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:55,230
 finite.

267
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,320
 And that's the contradiction

268
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,600
 because we know it should

269
00:06:58,609 --> 00:06:59,239
 be bounded.

270
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,359
 Therefore, our conclusion

271
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,989
 is it's not subjective.

272
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:04,209
 OK.

273
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,850
 Let's summarize what we have

274
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:06,410
 found.

275
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,700
 The spectrum of T contains

276
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,049
 our lambda values

277
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,630
 and also the accumulation

278
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,160
 points.

279
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,049
 You now it's not

280
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,480
 hard to show that these are

281
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:18,309
 indeed the only possibilities

282
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,170
 for the spectrum.

283
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,130
 So this is what the spectrum

284
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,809
 of the operator T looks

285
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,200
 like.

286
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,019
 The first part is the point

287
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,570
 spectrum of T, the eigen

288
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,260
 values.

289
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:28,869
 And the second part is the

290
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,510
 continuous spectrum together

291
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,029
 with the residual spectrum

292
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,230
 in fact, later, we will be

293
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,929
 able to show that for P

294
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,760
 less than infinity, the

295
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,510
 residual spectrum is indeed

296
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,109
 empty.

297
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,459
 Therefore, in our case, this

298
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,899
 is actually the continuous

299
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,540
 spectrum.

300
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:45,720
 OK.

301
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,700
 I think that's good enough

302
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,179
 for this example today,

303
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,290
 let's use the next videos

304
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:52,140
 to talk about general results

305
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:53,329
 about the spectrum.

306
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,079
 Therefore, I hope I see you

307
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:56,609
 there and have a nice day.

308
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:57,440
 Bye.
