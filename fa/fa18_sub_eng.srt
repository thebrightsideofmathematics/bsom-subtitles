00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:02,210
Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,490
functional analysis

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,289
and as always many, many

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,070
thanks to all the nice people

5
00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:08,449
that support me on Steady

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,250
or PayPal.

7
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,390
We've already reached part

8
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:12,829
18 in our course

9
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,090
and today we want to talk

10
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,010
about compact operators.

11
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,440
As the name suggests, this

12
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,579
has something to do with

13
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,389
the compact sets we've already

14
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:21,899
studied.

15
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,149
Therefore, recall that the

16
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:25,989
idea of compactness has

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,950
been to extend the notion

18
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:29,469
of finiteness a little bit.

19
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:31,709
A similar thing we will now

20
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,220
do for operators

21
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:34,310
Here

22
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:36,080
the analogue of finiteness would

23
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,799
be linear operators between

24
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,139
finite dimensional vector

25
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,799
spaces.

26
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,880
So let's look at an operator

27
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:43,340
from F^n to

28
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:45,319
F^m. On both sides,

29
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,889
we can just choose the normal

30
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,459
Euclidean norm, the standard

31
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,880
norm.

32
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:50,599
However, everything I say

33
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,729
now does not depend on the

34
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,220
norm.

35
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:53,529
It holds no matter which

36
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,529
norm you choose here.

37
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,409
The first step is not so

38
00:00:56,419 --> 00:00:57,970
hard to show, it tells us

39
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:59,150
that the linear operator

40
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,590
between finite dimensional

41
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:02,479
normed spaces is always

42
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,340
continuous

43
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:04,888
and of course, you already

44
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,330
know continuous means the

45
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:07,889
same as bounded for linear

46
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,669
operators.

47
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,809
In other words, the image

48
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,690
of the unit ball under T

49
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:13,889
is a bounded set.

50
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,839
Now, this is a bounded set

51
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:17,269
in our finite dimensional

52
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,769
normed space F^m

53
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:20,610
and there you know this is

54
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,089
one half of the things you

55
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:23,430
need for being compact.

56
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:25,510
However, the second ingredient

57
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,989
we just get when we form

58
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,410
the closure of this set.

59
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,389
This means that we just can

60
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,260
use a bar over the set

61
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:34,449
and then we get a set that

62
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:36,330
is always compact in

63
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:36,919
F^m.

64
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:38,989
With this essentially, you

65
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,510
now know what a compact

66
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,290
operators is.

67
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,470
When we look at the image

68
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,139
of the unit ball and form

69
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,819
the closure

70
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,309
and this set is compact,

71
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,279
we speak of a compact operator.

72
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,349
Of course, this always holds

73
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,910
in this case, but not in

74
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:53,500
general.

75
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,510
In order to see that let's

76
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,730
consider the identity

77
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:57,580
operator

78
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:58,330
in l^p.

79
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,610
Of course, identity operator

80
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,309
just means we take a sequence

81
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,980
x and send it to itself.

82
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:05,779
Therefore, calculating the

83
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,099
image of the unit ball is

84
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,660
not so hard. It stays the

85
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,380
unit ball.

86
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,160
Now we are interested in

87
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:12,259
the closure of the set.

88
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,779
So we use the bars again.

89
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,580
So what you have on the right-

90
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:17,009
hand side is just a closed

91
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:18,429
unit ball in l^p

92
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,169
and there we know from the

93
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:21,820
last video it's closed and

94
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,789
bounded, but not compact.

95
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:25,570
Hence, we have something

96
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,809
here,

97
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,350
we would not call a compact

98
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,059
operator, because the image

99
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,509
is just too large in this

100
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:30,929
case.

101
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:33,229
So you should always remember

102
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,910
compact operators is what

103
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,589
we get when we extend the

104
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,059
finite dimensional operators

105
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,070
here a little bit.

106
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:41,559
OK, then let's write down

107
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,740
the formal definition.

108
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,139
So we need two normed spaces

109
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,789
and often there will be Banach

110
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,449
spaces. Then a

111
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,910
bounded linear operator

112
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,500
T from X to

113
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:52,720
Y is called

114
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:53,559
compact,

115
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,720
if we have the thing we discussed

116
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:57,199
before, that this set

117
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,880
here is compact

118
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:00,699
in Y. Therefore, in the

119
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,509
case that Y is a finite

120
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,250
dimensional normed space, this

121
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,559
here is nothing special.

122
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,320
However, in the infinite

123
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,860
dimensional case, it really

124
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:09,309
is.

125
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:11,309
Hence, I would suggest that

126
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,710
we now look at a common

127
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,559
example. Let's

128
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,139
look at an integral operator

129
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:17,750
defined for the continuous

130
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,389
functions.

131
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,179
So it should take a function

132
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,149
defined from 0 to 1 and

133
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,850
send that to another function

134
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,710
in the same space

135
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,820
and as often the space of

136
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,139
continuous functions should

137
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:29,740
carry the supremum norm.

138
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,270
So what we can do is apply

139
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,960
the operator T to a function

140
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,880
f and then we get out a new

141
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:36,520
function.

142
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:38,169
Hence, we can look what the

143
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:39,410
function does at a given

144
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,410
point s, where s comes from

145
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:42,330
the unit interval.

146
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:44,210
Now the number that comes

147
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,449
out here should be given

148
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,220
by an integral from 0 to

149
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,190
1 where we have the function

150
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,690
f involved, but

151
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,570
also a fixed function

152
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,050
k

153
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,570
and this function should

154
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,500
get the variable s and also

155
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:57,550
the integration variable

156
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:57,949
t.

157
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,949
So we have a function with

158
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,539
two variables and for us

159
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,270
it should be also a continuous

160
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:03,710
function.

161
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,449
So we have it from C defined

162
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,350
on the unit interval times

163
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,330
the unit interval.

164
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,360
Now, since the function k

165
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:12,759
goes into the definition

166
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,710
of T, I put it into the

167
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,509
index here.

168
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,690
OK, then let's check if

169
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,059
T_k is indeed a

170
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,339
compact operator.

171
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,429
An important fact we will

172
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,230
need here is that the function

173
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:25,609
k is defined on a

174
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:26,709
compact set.

175
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,709
So it's not just continuous,

176
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,660
it's uniformly continuous.

177
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,730
To refresh your memory,

178
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,059
let's write down what this

179
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,929
exactly means.

180
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,540
For all epsilon greater zero,

181
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:39,260
there exists a delta greater

182
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:41,140
zero such that for

183
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,859
all points we put in and

184
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:44,440
now we need two variables

185
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,339
and for them, it should hold

186
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,779
if the distance is less than

187
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,420
delta, the distance of the

188
00:04:49,429 --> 00:04:50,820
images should be less than

189
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:51,589
epsilon.

190
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,100
On the left-hand side, we

191
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:54,170
measure the distance with

192
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,720
the Euclidean norm in R^2

193
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,100
and on the right-hand side,

194
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:58,399
we measure with the Euclidean

195
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,239
norm in R^1, which is the

196
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:00,940
absolute value.

197
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,600
Why we need the uniform continuity

198
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:05,299
here, we see in a moment.

199
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:06,859
The first step we have to

200
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:08,540
do when we see such an integral

201
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:10,399
operator is to check if

202
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,220
this integral defines

203
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,140
indeed a continuous function.

204
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:16,709
Simply because otherwise

205
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,029
the operator wouldn't be

206
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,850
well defined.

207
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:21,309
It really should map continuous

208
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,760
functions to continuous

209
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:23,440
functions.

210
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,140
Checking the continuity

211
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:26,549
then means we look at the

212
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,029
difference of the images

213
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,459
when we put in different

214
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:29,989
points.

215
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,059
So this should be small when

216
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,579
the points s_1 and s_2

217
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:34,630
are close together.

218
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,100
Therefore, we first calculate

219
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:38,290
and then we can look what

220
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:38,859
happens.

221
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,730
Now, the first thing you

222
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:41,769
should see here is that we

223
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:43,220
can put that into one

224
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,809
integral.

225
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,440
So use some parentheses here

226
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,119
and delete this integral

227
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,399
here.

228
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:50,640
Then of course, we pull in

229
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,239
the absolute value. Then we

230
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,279
get an inequality

231
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,589
and with this, we have everything

232
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,369
we need, because this one

233
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,000
here is less than a supremum

234
00:05:59,059 --> 00:05:59,989
norm of f

235
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,899
and this one by the uniform

236
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,859
continuity of k can be as

237
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:05,149
small as we want

238
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,390
and exactly this is what

239
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,670
we should formally write

240
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,230
in front of the whole calculation.

241
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:12,559
So for a given epsilon greater

242
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,700
than zero, we choose the

243
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,309
delta in such a way that

244
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,739
this whole thing holds.

245
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,440
Therefore, we can choose

246
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,000
s_1, s_2 from the unit

247
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,799
interval such that the distance

248
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:22,950
is less than delta.

249
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,489
For this s_1, s_2 here

250
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,420
and the same t on both sides,

251
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,910
we can apply what we know,

252
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,779
that this is less than epsilon.

253
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:33,500
By using also that this one

254
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,570
is less than the supremum

255
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,160
norm,

256
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,260
we are finished with the

257
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:37,820
whole integral. It's

258
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:39,690
simply less than epsilon

259
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,179
times the supremum norm

260
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:43,239
and because the supremum norm

261
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,910
of f is just a constant in

262
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,440
the whole calculation, we

263
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,369
now know that this function

264
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,839
is indeed continuous.

265
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,700
So we can note, our

266
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,109
operator as written as

267
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,950
here, is well defined.

268
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:57,390
However, our calculation

269
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,989
here shows us even more.

270
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:01,730
If we define the set A

271
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,299
as the image of the unit

272
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:05,279
ball, then we see

273
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,049
by this whole estimate here,

274
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,450
that the set A is

275
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,609
uniformly equi

276
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:10,470
continuous.

277
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:12,299
If you don't know what this

278
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:13,899
means anymore, let's write

279
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,609
it down again.

280
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,910
It just means that for all

281
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,279
epsilon greater zero, there

282
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,869
exists a delta such that

283
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,869
for all s_1, s_3 and all

284
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,600
g in A, we have the

285
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,959
uniform continuity

286
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,910
implication here.

287
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,709
From the definition of the

288
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,220
last video, I only had to

289
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,410
change some names.

290
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,260
I used the name g for the

291
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:33,540
function here, because we

292
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:35,279
already had a function f

293
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,269
and of course, we needed

294
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,859
the names s_1, s_2 for

295
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:39,660
the variables.

296
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,299
However, what you should

297
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:42,799
see is that this one is the

298
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:44,279
definition of a being

299
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,279
uniformly equicontinuous

300
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,119
and it's the same thing as

301
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,119
we have written here.

302
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:51,079
In other words, with the

303
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:52,559
calculation above, we have

304
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,279
proven that A is indeed

305
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,220
uniformly equicontinuous

306
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,029
at this point. You might

307
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,609
already guess that we want

308
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:01,350
to apply the Arzelà–Ascoli

309
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:02,079
theorem here.

310
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:04,329
Therefore, another step we

311
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:06,019
have to do is showing that

312
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,519
the whole set is bounded.

313
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,720
Or in other words that the

314
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,869
operator is bounded.

315
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,109
Hence, let's calculate the

316
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,070
operator norm.

317
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:14,989
So we have the supremum of

318
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,839
all the norms of the images,

319
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,600
where f has norm one

320
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,230
by the definition of the

321
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,230
supremum norm.

322
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,769
This is the supremum over

323
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,670
all s, where we calculate

324
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:25,690
the absolute value of the

325
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,299
integral.

326
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,630
As often, we can just pull

327
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,929
in the absolute value into

328
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,910
the integral and get an inequality

329
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,308
out

330
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,308
and with this, we are almost

331
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,840
finished, because the last

332
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,590
part here is less or

333
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,849
equal than the supremum norm

334
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:39,229
of f

335
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,260
and this is by assumption

336
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,028
just one. This

337
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,239
means that we don't need

338
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:45,708
the outer supremum anymore

339
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:47,179
and can just write down

340
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,789
everything is less or equal

341
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,979
than this integral.

342
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,940
However, this is also less

343
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,580
or equal than the supremum

344
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,419
norm of our function k.

345
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:58,320
As often, it's not important

346
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,080
what the number here is exactly.

347
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,599
It's only important that

348
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,500
it is constant, because then

349
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,280
we know that T_k is a

350
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:06,500
bounded operator

351
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,780
and now finally comes our

352
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,609
conclusion, we can apply

353
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:11,590
Arzelà–Ascoli.

354
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,830
This set, the image of the

355
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,690
unit ball is uniformly

356
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,630
equicontinuous and bounded.

357
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,940
Therefore, both things also

358
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,109
hold for the closure of the

359
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:21,630
set

360
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,669
and by Arzelà–Ascoli, we now

361
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,020
have a compact set

362
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,070
and by our definition, we

363
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,909
also know T_k,

364
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,750
the integral operator is

365
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,020
a compact operator.

366
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,270
So you see this was a long

367
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,030
example, but it is a standard

368
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,489
example for a compact

369
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,150
operator.

370
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:40,070
Of course, we will talk about

371
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,669
compact operators in later

372
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,869
videos even more.

373
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,330
Therefore, as always, I hope

374
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,150
I see you there.

375
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,950
Bye.
