00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,166
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,198 --> 00:00:03,326
 functional analysis.

3
00:00:03,438 --> 00:00:04,702
 And as always, I want to

4
00:00:04,726 --> 00:00:05,966
 thank all the nice people

5
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:07,214
 that support this channel

6
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:08,810
 on Steady or PayPal.

7
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,446
 We've reached part three

8
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:11,678
 in our course, and today

9
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:13,238
 we will talk about some important

10
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:15,210
 notions in metric spaces.

11
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,342
 Please recall a pair

12
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:19,238
 consisting of a set X and

13
00:00:19,254 --> 00:00:21,022
 a metric d is called a

14
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:21,930
 metric space.

15
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,054
 We've already discussed that

16
00:00:24,102 --> 00:00:25,838
 if you fix a point x in a

17
00:00:25,854 --> 00:00:27,374
 metric space, you can look

18
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:29,308
 at all the other points that

19
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:30,676
 have the same distance from

20
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:31,840
 this point x.

21
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,900
 Seeing that in the common

22
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,620
 geometry of the plane, this

23
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,908
 would be a circle around

24
00:00:36,964 --> 00:00:37,560
 x.

25
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,212
 Or in a three dimensional

26
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:41,180
 space it would be a sphere.

27
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,720
 Or you could call it a ball.

28
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,892
 Now exactly, this notion

29
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,396
 of a ball is what we want

30
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:47,196
 to generalize.

31
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:48,960
 For an abstract metric space,

32
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,140
 we write B epsilon

33
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,172
 x and call it the open

34
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:54,484
 epsilon ball around

35
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:55,586
 x.

36
00:00:55,768 --> 00:00:57,342
 It is defined as all the

37
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:59,214
 points y in our metric

38
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:01,126
 space X that fulfill

39
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:01,486
 that

40
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:03,310
 The distance from x to

41
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,222
 y is less than

42
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:07,010
 a given radius epsilon.

43
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,830
 However, this means that

44
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,582
 in the picture it's not the

45
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:12,450
 red line, it's everything

46
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,770
 inside.

47
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,838
 Now please note that for

48
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:18,422
 a given positive radius

49
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:20,430
 epsilon and a fixed point

50
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,028
 x from the metric space,

51
00:01:22,174 --> 00:01:24,168
 this epsilon ball is never

52
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,112
 empty, because at least the

53
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:27,800
 point x lies in this

54
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,420
 set.

55
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,672
 Using this definition of

56
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:32,384
 an epsilon ball, we can now

57
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:34,096
 talk about a lot of important

58
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,140
 notions in a metric space.

59
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,336
 The first one I want to show

60
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:39,880
 you is about open

61
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,740
 sets.

62
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,424
 You may already know what

63
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:44,280
 open means in Rn, but

64
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,048
 now we define it for arbitrary

65
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:47,816
 subsets of our metric

66
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:49,270
 space X.

67
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,304
 So let's take this subset

68
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:53,040
 A and I will use this

69
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,940
 symbol to denote a subset.

70
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,528
 Now descriptively, openness

71
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,360
 should mean that if you

72
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,208
 are inside the set A, you

73
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:02,704
 should never see the boundary

74
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:03,660
 of the set.

75
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,640
 In other words, if you fix

76
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,656
 an arbitrary point x of the

77
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:09,432
 set A, there should be enough

78
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,752
 points in all directions

79
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,592
 around this point that also

80
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,180
 belong to the set A.

81
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,426
 Of course, in order to describe

82
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,434
 this we can use such an epsilon

83
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:19,070
 ball.

84
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,202
 We just have to choose positive

85
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,826
 epsilon, but we can choose

86
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:24,750
 it as small as we need it.

87
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,690
 And if we can do that for

88
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,498
 each point separately, then

89
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:30,230
 we have an open set A.

90
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,002
 Therefore, the definition

91
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:33,682
 reads like set is called

92
00:02:33,746 --> 00:02:35,522
 open if for each point

93
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:37,090
 we can find such an epsilon

94
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,710
 ball.

95
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,098
 Of course, for each x you

96
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:41,498
 can choose another epsilon

97
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:42,470
 if needed.

98
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,132
 In the picture this would

99
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:45,668
 mean if you get closer to

100
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:47,676
 the boundary you need a smaller

101
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,840
 epsilon, of course.

102
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,964
 However, as long as you find

103
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:52,924
 for each point such an epsilon,

104
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:54,600
 we call the set open.

105
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,700
 Don't worry, we have

106
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,740
 consistency here.

107
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,700
 The so called open balls

108
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,420
 are also open with this

109
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,280
 definition.

110
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,652
 This is a simple exercise

111
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:06,160
 you can do for yourself.

112
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,692
 Now, with your knowledge

113
00:03:07,716 --> 00:03:09,396
 of open sets, you might also

114
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:11,330
 want to know what close sets

115
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:11,950
 are.

116
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,882
 However, before we do that,

117
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:15,442
 let's talk about so called

118
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:16,590
 boundary points.

119
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,730
 Let's take our arbitrary

120
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,642
 subset A again, and now

121
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,130
 we look in the picture maybe

122
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,706
 at points around

123
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:24,390
 here.

124
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,874
 At the moment it's not important

125
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:28,546
 if the point we have chosen

126
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:29,834
 is an element of our set

127
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:30,762
 a or not.

128
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,522
 Of course, it's a point in

129
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,470
 our whole metric space X.

130
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,626
 The important thing is that

131
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:38,474
 with these points we describe

132
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:40,090
 something that we could call

133
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,550
 the boundary of a.

134
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,526
 And of course we use the

135
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,006
 epsilon balls again for

136
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:45,610
 this.

137
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,790
 Now what you should see is

138
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,230
 if we have an epsilon ball

139
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,926
 around this point, then we

140
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,918
 hit points that are in a

141
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:54,142
 and we hit other points that

142
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:54,930
 are not.

143
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,070
 Of course, this clearly can

144
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,690
 happen.

145
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,702
 However, if it happens, no

146
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:01,046
 matter how small we choose

147
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:02,606
 the ball, then we are

148
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:04,414
 clearly on a thing we could

149
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:05,530
 call the boundary.

150
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,366
 Then the definition reads

151
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:09,390
 a point x from the whole

152
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,142
 metric space.

153
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:11,884
 X is called a boundary

154
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:13,812
 point for a if

155
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:15,348
 all open balls around

156
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:17,132
 x contain points

157
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:18,836
 from A and a complement of

158
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:19,440
 A.

159
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,644
 For the formula here we just

160
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,132
 use the intersection and

161
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:24,860
 say this one can't be

162
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,820
 empty and also not the

163
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,380
 one when you use the complement

164
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,240
 of a.

165
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,492
 There are some important

166
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:31,556
 things I should point out

167
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:31,948
 here.

168
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:33,748
 First, a boundary point

169
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:35,716
 can be inside a set A or

170
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:37,210
 outside, and

171
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,858
 secondly, the notion boundary

172
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:40,730
 point makes only sense with

173
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,314
 respect to a given subset

174
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:42,950
 A.

175
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,850
 There is a symbol to denote

176
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,442
 all the boundary points which

177
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:47,790
 is used very often.

178
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,418
 Its this curved del in

179
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:51,390
 front of A.

180
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,306
 So we put all the points

181
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:54,890
 x that are boundary points

182
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,906
 for A into this set.

183
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:59,066
 Now you can remember an open

184
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:00,778
 set is exactly such a set

185
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,058
 where all the boundary points

186
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:03,710
 are outside of A.

187
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,918
 When you see this, then you

188
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,262
 immediately understand what

189
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:08,850
 a closed set should be.

190
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,998
 It should be a set where

191
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:12,806
 all the boundary points belong

192
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:13,930
 to this set.

193
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,854
 Using the same formula.

194
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:17,782
 This reads A is closed

195
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:19,574
 if and only if A with the

196
00:05:19,622 --> 00:05:21,430
 union of the boundary is

197
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:21,646
 A 

198
00:05:21,678 --> 00:05:22,250
 again.

199
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,966
 However, that's not what

200
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:25,598
 one uses as the definition

201
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:26,678
 for closed sets.

202
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:28,530
 The definition is much simpler.

203
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,120
 A subset A in X is now

204
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,984
 called closed if the

205
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,832
 complement in X, which

206
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,560
 is AC, is

207
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,180
 open.

208
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,072
 This makes sense because

209
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:40,680
 the boundary points of A

210
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,136
 and a complement are exactly

211
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:42,940
 the same.

212
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,696
 And this just means that

213
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:45,960
 all the boundary points belong

214
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,540
 to A and not AC.

215
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,992
 Now the last notion for today

216
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:51,320
 will be the so called

217
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,300
 closure.

218
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,368
 The name already tells you

219
00:05:54,464 --> 00:05:56,448
 if you start with an arbitrary

220
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:58,098
 subset A, what you want to

221
00:05:58,114 --> 00:05:59,466
 get out is a closed

222
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:00,310
 subset.

223
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,874
 How to get this?

224
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:03,666
 You might already know, you

225
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,066
 just add all the missing

226
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,650
 boundary points, so you form

227
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,670
 the union with the boundary.

228
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,410
 And this is what we call

229
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,306
 the closure of A, and

230
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,066
 we denote that with A

231
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:15,110
 overline.

232
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,714
 Now please remember, this

233
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:19,490
 always defines a closed set.

234
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,130
 Indeed, it's the smallest

235
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,050
 closed set that still contains

236
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,022
 A. Okay, now

237
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:26,126
 I would suggest that the

238
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:27,822
 closure of this video is

239
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:28,890
 an example.

240
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,006
 It shouldn't be too complicated.

241
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:32,414
 So let's choose a metric

242
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:33,998
 space consisting of real

243
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:34,810
 numbers.

244
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,966
 X is now defined as all the

245
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:38,550
 numbers between one and three,

246
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,430
 where three is included and

247
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,170
 all numbers larger than four.

248
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,158
 And the metric is just defined

249
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:45,942
 as the normal distance function

250
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,730
 we have for real numbers.

251
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,926
 Okay, let's start considering

252
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,158
 some subsets of

253
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:53,242
 X, and the first

254
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:54,658
 one is the interval from

255
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,226
 one to three, which is of

256
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:57,706
 course a nice subset of

257
00:06:57,738 --> 00:06:58,310
 X.

258
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,626
 My question for you is now,

259
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:02,218
 is this also an open

260
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:02,870
 set?

261
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,570
 So this is how you should

262
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,586
 visualize the set.

263
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:08,594
 And now we look at each point

264
00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:10,642
 here and try to find an

265
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,290
 epsilon ball around this

266
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:12,910
 point.

267
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,074
 Now you see, this is

268
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:16,914
 possible for all x

269
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,810
 that are in A, but not

270
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,430
 three.

271
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,830
 What you can do is just look

272
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,246
 at the distance, what should

273
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:24,518
 be the boundary here, left

274
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,206
 and right, and choose the

275
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,462
 minimal you have.

276
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:29,102
 And if you want, you can

277
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,630
 make that even smaller.

278
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,206
 To get to the picture here,

279
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:34,170
 maybe you divide by two,

280
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,998
 and then the epsilon ball

281
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:38,646
 around x is

282
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:40,062
 indeed exactly

283
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,050
 inside the set a.

284
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,102
 However, if we want to have

285
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:45,946
 an open set, we need this

286
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:47,042
 property also for the

287
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,030
 point 3

288
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,322
 ok, so let's write down an

289
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:51,946
 epsilon ball, maybe with

290
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:53,190
 radius one.

291
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,322
 These are all the points

292
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:57,226
 y and x, where the distance

293
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:59,150
 is less than one.

294
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,354
 So let's write down that

295
00:08:01,402 --> 00:08:02,282
 as an interval.

296
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:03,922
 We already know that the

297
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:05,634
 interval two to three

298
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:07,114
 fulfills this property

299
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:07,802
 here.

300
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,234
 And the question is now,

301
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,714
 are there any other points

302
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:12,154
 that have distance less than

303
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:13,550
 one from three?

304
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,442
 It can't be anything here

305
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:16,962
 in this area because the

306
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:18,330
 points are too far away from

307
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,026
 three.

308
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:20,586
 And also in this interval

309
00:08:20,618 --> 00:08:22,110
 we don't find any points

310
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,954
 because the distance from

311
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:25,514
 three to four is already

312
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:27,106
 one, but four is not

313
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:28,642
 included in

314
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,162
 summary.

315
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:30,762
 Indeed, these are all the

316
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:32,230
 points we find in X.

317
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,506
 However, this is a subset

318
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:35,310
 of a.

319
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,242
 So our conclusion is

320
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,098
 indeed A is an open

321
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:39,750
 set.

322
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,350
 Okay, so this is an important

323
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,650
 thing to get today.

324
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,958
 The question openness makes

325
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:48,582
 only sense if you know what

326
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:50,070
 the surrounding universe,

327
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,862
 the whole metric space X

328
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:52,530
 is.

329
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,550
 Otherwise you won't be able

330
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,294
 to calculate the epsilon ball

331
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:57,730
 in X itself.

332
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,022
 In this case, the epsilon ball

333
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:01,530
 around three

334
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,406
 has only one side.

335
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:04,890
 So it looks like this.

336
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,160
 Now, what you can also show

337
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,912
 is that the set A here

338
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,620
 is also a closed set.

339
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,408
 This is what you also should

340
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,340
 immediately remember:

341
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,104
 Openness and closedness are

342
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:17,540
 not opposites.

343
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,480
 Surely you can have both

344
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,376
 at the same time.

345
00:09:20,488 --> 00:09:21,528
 But it can also happen that

346
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:23,280
 a set is neither closed nor

347
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,900
 open.

348
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,840
 Okay, so let's do a last

349
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,576
 example here.

350
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,256
 So this is our set C, one

351
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:29,952
 to two, where two is included.

352
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:31,376
 And I want to calculate the

353
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:32,920
 boundary of C.

354
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,818
 So this is our drawing for

355
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:35,850
 the set C.

356
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,170
 And you can immediately see

357
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,634
 that for all points below

358
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:40,154
 two, you can do the same

359
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:41,670
 thing as before here,

360
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,970
 which means you get an epsilon

361
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,778
 ball which is completely

362
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:47,354
 inside the set C itself.

363
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:49,350
 So it's not a boundary point.

364
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,442
 Which means the only point

365
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:52,898
 we have to consider now is

366
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:54,194
 the .2 itself.

367
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:55,890
 And then you see, immediately,

368
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,474
 if we look at an epsilon ball

369
00:09:57,522 --> 00:09:59,144
 around two, we will hit

370
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:00,840
 points here on the left and

371
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,060
 also on the right.

372
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,752
 Now there are points on the

373
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:05,848
 right that's different from

374
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:06,820
 the three before.

375
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,744
 Hence our boundary is just

376
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,384
 the, point 2 nothing

377
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:12,020
 more.

378
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,720
 And to conclude the whole

379
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,176
 video, maybe we also write

380
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,520
 down the closure of C.

381
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,620
 And you see, it's C itself,

382
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,744
 which means the set is

383
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:21,660
 closed.

384
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,992
 Okay, now I hope you understand

385
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:25,528
 these notions now a little

386
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,180
 better.

387
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,046
 And in the next video I will

388
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:29,750
 explain how we deal with

389
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,770
 them when we use sequences.

390
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,022
