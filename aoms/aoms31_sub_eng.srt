Hello and welcome back to the next mathematical symbol.

2
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:07,408
Which is the integral symbol denoted with this long S.

3
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:12,928
So whenever you see an integral, it always uses this stylized S

4
00:00:13,257 --> 00:00:19,725
and there you might already know, originally it comes from the word "sum" or the latin word "summa".

5
00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:29,261
Indeed if you want to see the integral as the area between the graph of the function and the x-axis, a sum helps us to calculate it.

6
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:36,555
I would always say, if you start calculating integrals, you first start calculating the area of rectangles

7
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:43,193
or more precisely, you would approximate the actual area with the sum of simple areas

8
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,757
and usually this approach is known as the Riemann integral.

9
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:52,568
So we would write: we have a sum over areas of rectangles.

10
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:58,332
Now, one rectangle has a height of f(x) and the width of delta x.

11
00:00:58,786 --> 00:01:05,692
So you see, this is not complicated at all. We just read the value of the function and the distance on the x-axis

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,647
and then summing it up gives us the whole area

13
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:15,953
and then you should see, in order to make the approximation better, we make the rectangles smaller and smaller.

14
00:01:16,214 --> 00:01:21,018
So in some sense we have a limit process, where delta x goes to 0

15
00:01:21,218 --> 00:01:28,711
and then the result of this limit process is the actual area. Which we now don't denote with this sigma, but with this long S

16
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:33,230
and moreover the delta x is then written as a dx.

17
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:39,538
So this would explain why we have exactly this nice notation here for denoting an integral.

18
00:01:39,738 --> 00:01:47,066
Moreover I can tell you. Besides this Riemann integral here, there are also other approaches to define integrals

19
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:53,725
and indeed they change the notation a little bit, but they don't change the long S for denoting the integral.

20
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:58,986
Now, if you want to learn more about this, I have a lot of videos about the Riemann integral

21
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:02,229
and about the modern version, the Lebesgue integral.

22
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,118
therefore I would say let's meet there or in the next video about mathematical symbols.

23
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,286
Have a nice day and Bye!
