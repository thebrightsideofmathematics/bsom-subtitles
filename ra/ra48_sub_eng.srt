00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,150
Hello and welcome back

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,070
to real analysis.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,510
And as always, first, I want

4
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,000
to thank all the nice people

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,020
that support this channel

6
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:10,489
on study or paypal.

7
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,880
Now, as you can see, we've

8
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,399
reached part 48 in the

9
00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:15,260
series.

10
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,010
And now we will start talking

11
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,600
about the Riemann integral.

12
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,909
Indeed, this will be the

13
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,549
last chapter we will cover

14
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,190
in this series about real

15
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,950
analysis.

16
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:27,350
You will see this notion

17
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,920
of an integral is as

18
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,850
important as the one we

19
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,200
already introduced.

20
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,479
Also this idea can be

21
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,040
nicely visualized with the

22
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:37,130
graph of a function.

23
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:39,500
So here you see the graph

24
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:41,189
of the function F which should

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,060
be defined on the interval

26
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:43,250
A

27
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,330
OK.

28
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,889
Now you might already know

29
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:48,560
the integral of the function

30
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:50,209
F is the orientated

31
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,689
area between the

32
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,630
graph and the X axis.

33
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,430
We say orientated

34
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,610
because there could be a

35
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:58,830
sign involved

36
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,880
more precisely.

37
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:02,130
This means that the parts

38
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:03,860
that are above the X axis

39
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:05,830
are positive and the parts

40
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:07,309
that are below the X axis

41
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,319
are negative.

42
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:10,459
Hence, at the moment for

43
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,669
this picture, it does not

44
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,989
matter because everything

45
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,349
here is above the X axis.

46
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,349
So we have a positive area.

47
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:17,779
OK.

48
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,160
But then the question is

49
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,610
how can we calculate this

50
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,059
area?

51
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:23,040
Then now I can

52
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,010
already tell you the overall

53
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,860
idea is that we approximate

54
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,230
it with rectangles.

55
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,500
Indeed, the procedure for

56
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,970
the Riemann integral is that

57
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,830
one chooses points on the

58
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:35,809
X axis and then draws

59
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:37,510
rectangles above them.

60
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,599
So you should see if we look

61
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,449
at one rectangle here, we

62
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,230
already have the width and

63
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,449
the height is then given

64
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,080
by one value of the function

65
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:48,550
F inside this

66
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:49,169
interval.

67
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,360
For example, the picture

68
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,720
then could look like this

69
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,680
where we have six rectangles.

70
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:57,510
And of course, the area of

71
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,809
a rectangle can be

72
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,440
calculated in a simple way.

73
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:02,989
It's just the width times

74
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,569
the height.

75
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,849
And then we just have to

76
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,610
sum up all the areas of the

77
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,970
rectangles to get an

78
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,880
approximation of the area

79
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:11,880
we are interested in.

80
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,630
Hence, when we give the points

81
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,059
here a name on the X axis.

82
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,750
So maybe it's simply X one

83
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,979
X two and so on.

84
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,740
Then the width of this

85
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,479
rectangle here is simply

86
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,380
X three minus X two.

87
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:26,660
So in general, we can just

88
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:28,660
write xj minus xj-1

89
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:29,399
.

90
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:31,690
And then in order to get

91
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,279
the area of the rectangle,

92
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,880
we have to multiply with

93
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:35,539
the height

94
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,419
for this the point, we choose

95
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:40,139
an interval to get the value

96
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:41,619
of the function we call

97
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,339
cj.

98
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:45,240
Therefore, here you see this

99
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,839
is the area of one

100
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,639
rectangle.

101
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:50,139
So in the last step, we simply

102
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,009
have the sum of all

103
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,210
these areas.

104
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,559
And in general, we can say

105
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,169
we have N rectangles that

106
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:58,259
are involved here.

107
00:02:59,279 --> 00:02:59,559
OK.

108
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,149
Then soon we will see how

109
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,839
we can do a limit process

110
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,720
and to infinity to get the

111
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:05,839
actual area.

112
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,419
In fact, instead of the sum,

113
00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:09,880
we will use this long as

114
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,979
as a symbol.

115
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,279
Otherwise, it looks similarly

116
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:14,839
because F is involved.

117
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,429
And instead of this difference

118
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,130
here, we write DX.

119
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,410
So this is the symbol for

120
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:21,740
the Riemann integral.

121
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,300
And often we put the bounds

122
00:03:23,309 --> 00:03:24,750
of the interval A and

123
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,229
B at the symbol.

124
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:27,720
OK.

125
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:29,160
What you really should remember

126
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:30,470
here is that for the Riemann

127
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,179
integral, we always start

128
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,429
with a partition of the X

129
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:33,979
axis.

130
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:36,500
And then with some procedure

131
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:38,279
I explain, soon we get to

132
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:39,669
the definition of the Riemann

133
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,639
integral of a function F

134
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,419
I always specify the name

135
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,080
Riemann here because there

136
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:47,740
is another important notion

137
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:49,669
a more modern one which is

138
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,139
called the integral.

139
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,789
Of course, in the end, both

140
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,970
definitions will describe

141
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:56,720
the same thing, namely the

142
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,470
orientated area between the

143
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,929
graph and the X axis.

144
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,059
However, it turns out that

145
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,429
the la back integral works

146
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,089
more generally, which means

147
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,910
you can apply to more functions.

148
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,619
But since the Riemann is

149
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,179
not hard to explain, it's

150
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,460
good to start with it.

151
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,199
If you are interested in

152
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,380
the Lebesgue integral, I have

153
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,089
a whole other series about

154
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:18,149
it.

155
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:19,329
OK.

156
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,079
However, here we will explain

157
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,470
the Riemann integral which

158
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,779
means we have to start with

159
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,470
the partition of the X axis.

160
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,989
More precisely, we will define

161
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,299
the name partition of the

162
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:31,000
compact interval A B.

163
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,869
Now you have already seen

164
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,709
above it's simply a set that

165
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,709
consists of points we choose

166
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,029
inside the interval.

167
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,649
Indeed, what one often does

168
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,059
is to include the boundary

169
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,000
points A and B as well.

170
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,160
Therefore, we start at the

171
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,070
point X zero, then comes

172
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,940
X one X two and

173
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,440
so on.

174
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,579
And the last point should

175
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:53,519
be XN.

176
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,869
So you see it should be a

177
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,049
finite set

178
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,609
and the defining property

179
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:01,230
of the set you also see

180
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:01,769
above.

181
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:03,399
So we have an order of the

182
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:03,980
points.

183
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,679
Hence X zero is the smallest

184
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,339
one, then comes X one and

185
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:08,839
so on.

186
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,630
So we have strict inequalities

187
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,230
here and

188
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,950
also X zero should also

189
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,679
be A and XN

190
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,709
should be B

191
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,480
OK.

192
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:20,440
So this is the whole definition

193
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,200
of the notion partition

194
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:23,239
of an interval.

195
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:25,750
Now for such a partition

196
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,739
and a function F, we could

197
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,470
calculate this sum here.

198
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,910
However, because this could

199
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,640
be hard, we should first

200
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,329
start with functions F that

201
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,809
are not so complicated.

202
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,000
In fact, the functions we

203
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,500
now consider are usually

204
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,079
called step functions

205
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,200
to make everything simpler

206
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:44,890
to read.

207
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,700
I now use Greek letters

208
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:47,940
for the step functions.

209
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,470
So here we have a lower case

210
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,450
phi so the

211
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,589
function should be defined

212
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,570
on the interval A B and we

213
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:57,380
call it a step function if

214
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,130
it's piece wisely constant.

215
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,429
This means if we look at

216
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,070
the graph, we only see

217
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,339
horizontal lines.

218
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,980
Therefore maybe let's immediately

219
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:08,049
visualize this.

220
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,179
For example, maybe the function

221
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,559
starts with one, will you

222
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,239
hear then comes

223
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,589
another value here

224
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,230
and then the next one could

225
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:18,709
be here.

226
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,540
For example, so you

227
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:21,899
see it doesn't have to be

228
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,579
a complete constant function.

229
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:24,839
There could be jumps, there

230
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,109
could be a lot of jumps but

231
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,470
only finally many,

232
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,869
which means for example,

233
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,890
you could restrict it to

234
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,380
an interval maybe here.

235
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:33,869
And then you have a constant

236
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,329
function,

237
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:36,959
maybe it's also important

238
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,230
to note here that the

239
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:40,119
values at the jump points

240
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,380
don't matter at all.

241
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,109
For example, this is allowed

242
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:44,709
to happen.

243
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:47,339
And maybe you already know

244
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,230
why this is because the

245
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:51,209
area below this curve

246
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,149
to the x axis does not

247
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,820
care what this will is.

248
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:57,350
And of course, in the end,

249
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,470
we will be interested in

250
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,290
this area because it's the

251
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:01,070
integral.

252
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,570
OK.

253
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:03,850
Then let's describe this

254
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:05,250
definition of a piece wise

255
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,109
constant function in a formal

256
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:07,410
way.

257
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,820
And as you might guess we

258
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,619
can use a partition here for

259
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,899
the interval A B,

260
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,149
this means that the best

261
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,869
idea would be to set these

262
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,429
points X one X two and so

263
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,019
on at these jump

264
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:21,839
points because

265
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,500
then we have the corresponding

266
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,250
intervals where the function

267
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,239
is constant.

268
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:28,809
However, then it's also no

269
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,769
problem at all fixing these

270
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,000
constant values.

271
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,140
So let's call them C one

272
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:35,690
C two and so on.

273
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,100
Indeed, what could happen

274
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:39,420
is that some values

275
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:40,250
coincide.

276
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:42,079
So here we have that the

277
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:43,779
value in this interval is

278
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,470
the same as in this one.

279
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:47,519
This is not a problem.

280
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,679
The important thing is that

281
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,339
for each interval, we have

282
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,709
such a number CJ,

283
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,320
which means we have any of

284
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:54,670
them.

285
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,290
OK.

286
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:57,839
And now we can write down

287
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,649
the defining property we've

288
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,750
already discussed,

289
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:03,299
meaning that we can restrict

290
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:04,929
the function phi to an

291
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,649
interval.

292
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,019
Namely, we can do this for

293
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,420
each interval that starts

294
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:11,339
with XJ minus one and

295
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,480
ends with XJ.

296
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:14,890
Indeed, in order to avoid

297
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:16,690
these jump points here, we

298
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,250
need the open intervals.

299
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:19,549
OK.

300
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:20,970
And now we know restricted

301
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,529
to this interval, it's a

302
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,690
constant function

303
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:26,029
and the value is given by

304
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,950
CJ.

305
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,429
OK.

306
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,820
And of course, every time

307
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:31,089
you see something like this,

308
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,729
it means it should hold for

309
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:34,650
all possible values of J.

310
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,308
Well, now you know what we

311
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,909
call a step function when

312
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,390
we want to define the Riemann

313
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,070
integral.

314
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:43,629
So you see it's not

315
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:44,929
complicated at all.

316
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,169
Also the integral should

317
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:48,849
not be complicated because

318
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,729
we immediately see the rectangles

319
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,880
here we could use

320
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,200
and then these rectangles

321
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,929
exactly describe the

322
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,799
area between the graph and

323
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:58,739
the X axis.

324
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,820
Therefore, my question for

325
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,520
you would be, can we immediately

326
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,229
define the integral for

327
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:05,390
such a step function?

328
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:07,820
Please recall this is the

329
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,640
symbol that is a number

330
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,559
that represents the orientated

331
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,200
area.

332
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,770
This means in this case,

333
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,369
we just have to add

334
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,770
all the areas of the

335
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,729
rectangles here.

336
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,140
So we have a sum that starts

337
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,020
with one and goes to N

338
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,640
also we know the height is

339
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,580
given by CJ and

340
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,900
the width is given by the

341
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:30,549
difference of these two points

342
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:30,849
here.

343
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,109
So what we see here is in

344
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,049
this case, the integral

345
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:36,690
is given by this finite

346
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,200
sum.

347
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:39,400
However, what we need to

348
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:41,299
answer here is, is this a

349
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:42,479
correct definition?

350
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:45,030
Because at first, it seems

351
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,940
that there are a lot of possibilities

352
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,080
to choose the petition of

353
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,960
the interval and also to

354
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,809
choose the numbers CJ.

355
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:54,010
However, here on the left

356
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,440
hand side, neither the

357
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,210
partition nor the number

358
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:58,409
CJ occur.

359
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,140
In summary.

360
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,659
What we need to show is that

361
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,309
this here is well

362
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,979
defined.

363
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:06,539
OK, then please think about

364
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:08,049
it and then we can talk about

365
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:09,809
it together in the next video.

366
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,960
Therefore, I hope I see you

367
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:13,429
there and have a nice day.

368
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:14,280
Bye.
