00:00:00,409 --> 00:00:02,349
 Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:03,960
 real analysis.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,849
 And obviously, as always

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,079
 first, I want to thank all

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,279
 the nice people that support

6
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:09,399
 this channel on study or

7
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:10,069
 paypal.

8
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:11,680
 Now we've almost reached

9
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:12,960
 a point in the series where

10
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,399
 we can talk about the famous

11
00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:16,229
 mean value theorem.

12
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,909
 However, before we are able

13
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,209
 to prove it, we first have

14
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,760
 to talk about local extrema

15
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,629
 and the theorem of Rolle.

16
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,500
 Hence today, we will do the

17
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,659
 whole ground work we will

18
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,459
 need for the mean value theorem.

19
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:29,030
 So let's immediately start

20
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,250
 with the definition of a

21
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,180
 local maximum for

22
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:32,418
 this.

23
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,369
 Let's fix an interval I and

24
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,549
 a function F.

25
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,229
 Now, in order to understand

26
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,919
 what we want to define let's

27
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,389
 visualize the graph.

28
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,259
 So maybe we have something

29
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,150
 like this and the

30
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,610
 point like this, we want

31
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,360
 to call a local maximum

32
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,200
 or more concretely, we are

33
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:50,700
 interested in the point X

34
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,439
 zero at the X axis.

35
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,340
 In this case, you would say

36
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:55,900
 the function F has a local

37
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:57,380
 maximum at this point.

38
00:00:57,909 --> 00:00:58,290
 OK.

39
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,500
 And now of course, we should

40
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:00,979
 think about what this should

41
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,180
 essentially mean.

42
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:03,970
 Now, the value of the function

43
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:05,540
 at this point does not have

44
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,900
 to be the maximum of the

45
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,500
 function.

46
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,360
 However, it should be

47
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,230
 maximal when we only consider

48
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,529
 a neighborhood around this

49
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,000
 point.

50
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,949
 Or to be more precise, we

51
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,470
 only consider a neighborhood

52
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,220
 around the point X zero on

53
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,129
 the X axis.

54
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,639
 And this one we simply call

55
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,139
 you.

56
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:24,040
 So we just need a neighborhood

57
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,080
 in the real numbers.

58
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:26,129
 And if you want, you can

59
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:27,720
 choose an epsilon neighborhood.

60
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,459
 And of course, it just have

61
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,139
 to be small enough such that

62
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,720
 our condition here holds.

63
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,610
 Hence, in the formula, this

64
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,180
 would mean that F of X

65
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,980
 zero is equal to the

66
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:39,690
 maximum of the function when

67
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,489
 we only consider points from

68
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,300
 the neighborhood.

69
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,690
 Hence, we have X in U

70
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:46,139
 intersected with I

71
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,169
 with this intersection, we

72
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,540
 also include points that

73
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,900
 lie on the boundary of the

74
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,480
 interval.

75
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,309
 Otherwise it's exactly the

76
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,949
 same thing we explained here

77
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,720
 in the graph.

78
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,900
 And there, you also see we

79
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,410
 can do the same thing for

80
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,580
 a local minimum.

81
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:02,620
 Therefore, I would say let's

82
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:04,459
 add this to our definition.

83
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:06,650
 So we say the function F

84
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,220
 has a local minimum at the

85
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,429
 point X zero.

86
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,300
 If there is a neighborhood

87
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:12,889
 of X zero also called

88
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,619
 U such that F of X

89
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,059
 zero is the minimum of the

90
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,580
 function when we restrict

91
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:18,960
 it to the neighborhood U.

92
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,050
 So you see it's exactly the

93
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:22,580
 same definition as before,

94
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:23,899
 just with a minimum.

95
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:25,559
 Then finally, we have the

96
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,080
 last part of the definition

97
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:28,470
 which is about local

98
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,119
 extrema.

99
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,559
 In fact, this is just a name

100
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,520
 to combine both maximum and

101
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,699
 minimum from before.

102
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:36,869
 Hence we say F has a local

103
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,779
 extrem at X zero, if

104
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:40,509
 F has a local maximum or

105
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,240
 a local minimum at X zero.

106
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,449
 So you see this is not complicated

107
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,229
 at all, but maybe I still

108
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,639
 show you some sketches.

109
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,979
 Therefore, here in the coordinate

110
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,600
 system, we have our interval

111
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,220
 I as a bounded one.

112
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,190
 Then for example, the graph

113
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,860
 of F could look like this.

114
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,500
 And they, you see on the

115
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:00,339
 left boundary we have a local

116
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,059
 maximum.

117
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,059
 And on the right hand boundary,

118
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,539
 we have a local minimum.

119
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,339
 Moreover, another local

120
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,059
 maximum, we also find here

121
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,360
 also another local minimum

122
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:11,500
 we find here.

123
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:13,240
 So please don't forget a

124
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,529
 local maximum could look

125
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:15,149
 like this.

126
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,929
 But of course, when we deal

127
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,330
 with differentiable functions,

128
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:19,770
 something like this cannot

129
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:20,169
 happen.

130
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,279
 In fact, for differential

131
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:23,410
 functions, we have a very

132
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:24,889
 nice necessary condition

133
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:25,979
 for local extrema.

134
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:28,119
 So let's put this into a

135
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,889
 proposition.

136
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,809
 However, we don't have this

137
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,630
 condition for boundary points.

138
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,660
 Therefore, I immediately

139
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:35,309
 choose an open interval as

140
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,169
 the domain.

141
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,880
 Now our assumption here is

142
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,210
 that at the point X zero,

143
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,600
 we are interested in the

144
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,210
 function is differentiable.

145
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,339
 And then we have the following

146
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,199
 implication if

147
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,660
 F has a local extremum at

148
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,649
 x zero, so a local maximum

149
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,500
 or minimum, then

150
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:53,440
 F prime of X zero

151
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:54,899
 is equal to zero.

152
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,050
 So the derivative has to

153
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:58,380
 vanish at this point.

154
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,279
 Now please immediately note

155
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:01,940
 here, this does not work

156
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,000
 the other way around.

157
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,029
 Now, both things we can immediately

158
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,509
 explain in a picture.

159
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,270
 For example, if we have a

160
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,940
 local maximum here, the

161
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,559
 slope at the point if it

162
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,479
 exists needs to be zero.

163
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,369
 So we have a tangent that

164
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,350
 is horizontal.

165
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,170
 However, this horizontal

166
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:19,858
 tangent can't be sufficient

167
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:21,010
 for a local extremum

168
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,220
 because we also have it at

169
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,140
 this point for such a curve.

170
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,059
 And there at this point,

171
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,640
 we don't have a local minimum

172
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:30,040
 and also not a local

173
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:30,760
 maximum.

174
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:32,579
 Therefore, please always

175
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,010
 have this direction here

176
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:34,540
 in mind.

177
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:35,579
 OK.

178
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:37,000
 Then I guess we are ready

179
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,859
 for the proof of this statement.

180
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,950
 And there we will distinguish

181
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,850
 two cases,

182
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,019
 namely, we first consider

183
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,950
 that F has a local maximum

184
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,859
 at X zero.

185
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,859
 And then obviously the second

186
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:50,309
 case will be that F has a

187
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,049
 local minimum at X zero.

188
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:52,859
 OK.

189
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:54,170
 Then by the definition of

190
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,579
 a local maximum, we can

191
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,519
 conclude that there is a

192
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,940
 neighborhood of X zero.

193
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,100
 We call you

194
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,170
 here.

195
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:02,390
 Very importantly, to note

196
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,630
 is because we have an inner

197
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,959
 point, we can choose the

198
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,940
 neighborhood inside the interval.

199
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,869
 AB otherwise we have the

200
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,649
 same property here, namely

201
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,450
 F of X zero is the maximum

202
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,000
 of the function when we only

203
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,190
 consider points from the

204
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,890
 neighborhood.

205
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:17,480
 Now, in the next step, what

206
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:18,779
 we can put in is that the

207
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,579
 function F is differentiable

208
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:21,989
 at our point X zero.

209
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,730
 This means we have a 

210
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,049
 linearization around this

211
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,709
 point in general.

212
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,279
 This means we can write F

213
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,190
 of X as F of

214
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,989
 X zero plus X minus X

215
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,910
 zero times our slope function

216
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,459
 delta.

217
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,239
 And here please recall the

218
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,059
 important property for differentiability

219
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,859
 is that this function

220
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:41,540
 here is continuous at the

221
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,540
 point X zero.

222
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,459
 This is not what we can use

223
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,839
 to show that the slope at

224
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,579
 X zero is zero.

225
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,859
 Intuitively.

226
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:50,220
 It makes sense that we have

227
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,739
 it because if we would have

228
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,130
 a tangent with a positive

229
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,059
 slope, then we cannot have

230
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,890
 a local maximum here because

231
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,470
 the value will increase when

232
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,510
 we go to the right.

233
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:01,779
 Therefore, let's try to

234
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,769
 prove this.

235
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,709
 So we assume that at the

236
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,359
 point X zero, the function

237
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:07,570
 delta which is the

238
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:09,309
 derivative is greater than

239
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,929
 zero.

240
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,269
 Now, since we have continuity,

241
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,089
 we also know the function

242
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,359
 is greater than zero in a

243
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:16,700
 small neighborhood around

244
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,410
 X zero, let's call the

245
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,489
 neighborhood V.

246
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,720
 And of course, we can choose

247
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,149
 it as a subset of U.

248
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:23,910
 Now, this is the important

249
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,809
 property we can use to construct

250
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,429
 the contradiction as a

251
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,010
 reminder.

252
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:29,329
 Another way to interpret

253
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,010
 this property here is to think

254
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:31,929
 of secants.

255
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:33,600
 If the slope of the tangent

256
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:34,959
 is positive, then you also

257
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,040
 find a small neighborhood

258
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:37,579
 around X zero such that the

259
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:39,179
 slopes of the secants is

260
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,350
 positive as well.

261
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,690
 However, now if we have this,

262
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,399
 we cannot have a maximum

263
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,190
 at X zero, you immediately

264
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,910
 see this in the picture because

265
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,079
 on the right hand side of

266
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:50,809
 X zero, we find larger

267
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,399
 values than at the point

268
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:52,989
 X zero.

269
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:54,980
 We can also show this when

270
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:56,679
 we use our identity here

271
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:59,010
 because here, if X is in

272
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,170
 the neighborhood V we

273
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:01,399
 have a positive number.

274
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,290
 And if we choose X on the

275
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:04,730
 right hand side of X zero,

276
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:06,679
 this is also positive number.

277
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:08,730
 In summary, all points X

278
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:10,010
 in the neighborhood fulfill

279
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:11,790
 that F of X is greater

280
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,769
 than F of X zero, which

281
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:15,410
 simply means that F of X

282
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,950
 zero is not a local

283
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,690
 maximum.

284
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:18,440
 OK.

285
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,720
 Then let's look at the second

286
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,630
 possibility here that F prime

287
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,320
 of X zero is less than

288
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:23,880
 zero.

289
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,480
 There, you see we can just

290
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:27,000
 flip the picture from before

291
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:28,579
 and do the same argumentation

292
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:29,019
 again.

293
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,779
 So we can take a neighborhood

294
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,720
 V in you such that we have

295
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,850
 the negative slope in the

296
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:34,820
 whole neighborhood.

297
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,130
 Now, the only thing we have

298
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,529
 to change from before is

299
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,980
 that we now look at the left

300
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:40,940
 hand side because then

301
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,619
 both factors in the product

302
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,010
 on the right hand side are

303
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,380
 less than zero.

304
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,290
 Hence, the product itself

305
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:48,459
 is positive again,

306
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,480
 which gives us exactly the

307
00:07:50,489 --> 00:07:52,339
 same contradiction as before.

308
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,010
 Therefore, in summary, we

309
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,790
 know these two cases here

310
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,380
 are not possible at all.

311
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,239
 So the only possibility that

312
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,920
 remains is that F prime is

313
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,269
 exactly zero,

314
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,130
 which is exactly what we

315
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,119
 wanted to prove.

316
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,649
 Now, to finish the proof,

317
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,279
 we just have to do this second

318
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,269
 case, which means now instead

319
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,630
 of a maximum, we consider

320
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,200
 that F has a local minimum

321
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:13,910
 at X zero.

322
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,450
 However, I don't think I

323
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,049
 have to write this down because

324
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:18,709
 now we have all the ideas

325
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,899
 and you can do a similar

326
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,089
 proof as before.

327
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,970
 In fact, what I want to do

328
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,019
 in the next minutes is to

329
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:25,690
 show you the important theorem

330
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,649
 of Rolle this one is

331
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,549
 applicable if we have a differentiable

332
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,470
 function on a compact interval.

333
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,150
 Now it's important that we

334
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,808
 have these two boundary points

335
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,710
 A and B because we

336
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,799
 need the assumption that

337
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,599
 F of A is equal to F of

338
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:40,000
 B.

339
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,169
 Now in a picture in a graph,

340
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,450
 this would mean we start

341
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,169
 here at a given value and

342
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:46,200
 then the function can do

343
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,119
 a lot of things, but we end

344
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,510
 at the same value again,

345
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,609
 then the claim will be that

346
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:53,190
 we find at least one point

347
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,390
 where we have a horizontal

348
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,260
 tangent and this point

349
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,190
 on the X axis we will call

350
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,010
 X hat.

351
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,020
 In other words, we find X

352
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,710
 hat in the interval such

353
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,330
 that F prime of X hat is

354
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,210
 equal to 01

355
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:07,450
 important part here is that

356
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,210
 X hat is not a boundary

357
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:09,690
 point.

358
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,969
 So we have an inner point

359
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:11,950
 of the interval.

360
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:13,030
 OK.

361
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,659
 I would say Rolle's theorem

362
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,289
 here seems very natural.

363
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,030
 If we have such a function

364
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,479
 like this, there should be

365
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:21,070
 a local minimum or a local

366
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,119
 maximum somewhere.

367
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,020
 Therefore, let's immediately

368
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,309
 try to prove it.

369
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,190
 Let's again, start with a

370
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,909
 simple case namely that the

371
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,700
 function F is constant.

372
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,960
 Then of course, it's differentiable

373
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,169
 and fulfills the condition

374
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,909
 that F of A is equal to F

375
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,479
 of B.

376
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,400
 But also the derivative is

377
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:39,450
 equal to zero.

378
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,570
 And this holds for all X

379
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,729
 in the whole interval.

380
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,570
 So we can simply choose any

381
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,250
 point for X hat and we are

382
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,890
 finished.

383
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,900
 Hence, the only interesting

384
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:50,840
 case is that F is not a

385
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:51,909
 constant function.

386
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:52,849
 OK.

387
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,770
 And now we can use that F

388
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,650
 is defined on a compact set.

389
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,599
 And by assumption differentiable

390
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,510
 which in particular means

391
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,090
 it's a continuous function.

392
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:04,679
 And for these, we know the

393
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,559
 image of a compact set is

394
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,080
 also a compact set.

395
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:09,820
 This is what we have proven

396
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,159
 in part 30.

397
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:13,020
 In particular, we have proven

398
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,320
 that we always find the point

399
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,849
 X minus where the minimum

400
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:17,650
 occurs and the point X

401
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,450
 plus where the maximum occurs.

402
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,440
 Now, of course, one of the

403
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,799
 points could lie on the

404
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:23,690
 boundary.

405
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:25,539
 However, because the function

406
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:27,419
 is not constant, the other

407
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:28,440
 one cannot.

408
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:30,440
 And exactly this one, we

409
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,000
 can choose as x hat.

410
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:33,979
 Therefore, this means we

411
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:35,250
 have the maximum or the

412
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,179
 minimum in the middle somewhere.

413
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:39,130
 In fact, it's the global

414
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,510
 maximum or minimum,

415
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,950
 which is of course also a

416
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,909
 local one.

417
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,890
 Hence, we can simply use

418
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,429
 the proposition from before

419
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:49,869
 which tells us that the derivative

420
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,340
 vanishes at the local

421
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:52,109
 extremum.

422
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:54,190
 And with this, the proof

423
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,049
 is finished.

424
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,489
 In fact, this nice theorem

425
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,929
 of Rolle we can use in the

426
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,840
 next video because

427
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:02,500
 there we will prove the famous

428
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,250
 mean value theorem.

429
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:05,830
 Therefore, I hope I see you

430
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,289
 there and have a nice day.

431
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:08,130
 Bye.
