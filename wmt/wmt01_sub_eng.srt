00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,310
 Hello and welcome to this

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,078
 video about the Weierstrass

3
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:04,970
 M test.

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,782
 This is a topic from real

5
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:08,222
 analysis, so if you want

6
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:09,390
 to learn more, you should

7
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,974
 check out my real analysis

8
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:11,610
 course.

9
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,374
 However, before we start

10
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:15,070
 with this M test, I really

11
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,270
 want to thank all the nice

12
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,462
 people who support this channel

13
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:18,926
 on Steady here on YouTube

14
00:00:18,998 --> 00:00:20,326
 or via other means.

15
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:21,966
 And please don't forget with

16
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:23,230
 the link in the description

17
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,918
 you find additional material

18
00:00:25,014 --> 00:00:26,798
 like PDF versions, quizzes

19
00:00:26,854 --> 00:00:27,970
 and other stuff.

20
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:28,968
 Okay.

21
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:30,328
 With this I would say we

22
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:32,184
 can immediately start explaining

23
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:34,100
 the Weierstrass M test.

24
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,808
 Now what you should remember

25
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:37,808
 is that this M test is

26
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:39,168
 a comparison test for

27
00:00:39,224 --> 00:00:40,696
 series, but for the

28
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:42,552
 uniform convergence for

29
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,140
 a sequence of functions.

30
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,744
 So it's not so complicated

31
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:46,320
 at all.

32
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,256
 And it's called m test simply

33
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:49,728
 because the constants in

34
00:00:49,744 --> 00:00:51,168
 the theorem are called

35
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:51,952
 M.

36
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,224
 And there I would say we

37
00:00:53,232 --> 00:00:54,384
 can immediately formulate

38
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:55,340
 this statement.

39
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,436
 And as already mentioned,

40
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:59,060
 the only thing you need here

41
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,500
 is to know what a series

42
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,100
 is and the uniform

43
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,540
 convergence for a sequence

44
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,520
 of functions.

45
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,268
 And these functions can be

46
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:07,516
 defined on any set.

47
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:09,188
 So let's call it D.

48
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:11,108
 And indeed, often we have

49
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:13,060
 that D is a subset of the

50
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,160
 real numbers.

51
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,452
 Hence our functions fk

52
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:18,100
 should have D as their

53
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,916
 domain.

54
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:20,356
 And now the functions could

55
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:22,164
 be real valued or complex

56
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:23,110
 valued.

57
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,786
 So in general we could just

58
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:26,386
 write that they map into

59
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:28,298
 the complex numbers and

60
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:29,594
 then we have a function for

61
00:01:29,642 --> 00:01:31,218
 each k in the natural

62
00:01:31,274 --> 00:01:33,026
 numbers, so already

63
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:34,882
 a whole sequence of functions

64
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:36,790
 with the same domain D.

65
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,570
 However, for the Weierstrass

66
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,050
 M test we are interested

67
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,866
 in the partial sums, so the

68
00:01:41,898 --> 00:01:43,630
 series of these functions.

69
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,466
 And to have the convergence

70
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:46,994
 of this series, we

71
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:48,818
 assume that we have constants

72
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:50,732
 with the name M.

73
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:52,328
 And as already mentioned,

74
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:53,632
 this is the whole reason

75
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,540
 we call it the M test.

76
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,304
 Now we have two assumptions

77
00:01:57,352 --> 00:01:58,400
 for these constants.

78
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,744
 First, they should be non

79
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,496
 negative, and second, the

80
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:02,480
 series should be

81
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,576
 convergent.

82
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:05,280
 This means that the limit

83
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,096
 of the partial sums should

84
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:07,900
 exist.

85
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,960
 In other words, the value

86
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,960
 of the series is not equal

87
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,096
 to infinity.

88
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:14,696
 And now in addition, the

89
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:16,256
 constants should be always

90
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:17,836
 bigger than the values

91
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:19,760
 of the functions fk.

92
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,844
 More precisely, we look at

93
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,684
 f k of x and take

94
00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:25,640
 the absolute value of this,

95
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,444
 and then this should be less

96
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:28,676
 or equal than

97
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,560
 M_k.

98
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,580
 And indeed we want that for

99
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,492
 all k in n and for

100
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:35,092
 all x in D.

101
00:02:35,276 --> 00:02:36,980
 So the constants M_k

102
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,044
 form a uniform majorant

103
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,160
 for the functions.

104
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,324
 Ok, so these are the assumptions

105
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:43,752
 we need, and then we get

106
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:45,320
 the result for the series

107
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,180
 of the functions fk.

108
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,872
 Indeed, by the comparison

109
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,472
 test for series we

110
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,576
 immediately get that the

111
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:53,208
 sequence of partial sums

112
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:55,336
 converges for every x in

113
00:02:55,368 --> 00:02:56,016
 D.

114
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,928
 However, we get even more

115
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:59,736
 because we deal with functions.

116
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:01,120
 The term uniform

117
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,560
 convergence also makes

118
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,296
 sense.

119
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:05,392
 So we get out that the series

120
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:06,704
 is uniformly

121
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:07,740
 convergent.

122
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,808
 Moreover, as a side note,

123
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:11,488
 I should also mention that

124
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:12,888
 we have the same result for

125
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:14,192
 the absolute value of the

126
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:14,940
 functions.

127
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,168
 So both nice things come

128
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:18,640
 out of the Weierstrass M-

129
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,288
 test.

130
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:20,736
 Now, in the case you don't

131
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,144
 know exactly what the term

132
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:23,856
 uniform convergence means,

133
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:25,616
 let me refresh your memory

134
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:26,208
 here.

135
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:27,528
 Now, the first thing you

136
00:03:27,544 --> 00:03:28,808
 should see here is that we

137
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:30,248
 get a well defined function

138
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:32,100
 we can call S,

139
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,864
 and this one has the same

140
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:35,592
 domain D and it sends

141
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:37,460
 x to this series.

142
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,562
 And what I mean there is

143
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,506
 that we just sum up f

144
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:43,530
 k of x and

145
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,842
 this limit should exist.

146
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:46,266
 So we get a well defined

147
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:47,510
 function S.

148
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,538
 And moreover, this capital

149
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:51,426
 S is the limit of the

150
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,042
 partial sums of the functions

151
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:53,882
 fk.

152
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,954
 And when I say limit, I mean

153
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,650
 with respect to the supremum

154
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,378
 norm.

155
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,306
 And please recall, the supremum

156
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:02,210
 norm is usually denoted with

157
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,906
 this infinity sign on the

158
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:04,590
 norm.

159
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,626
 Now, S is the uniform

160
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:08,362
 limit for the partial sums.

161
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:10,178
 So this goes to zero when

162
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:11,710
 n goes to infinity.

163
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,026
 Hence, this is exactly what

164
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:15,354
 we mean by the uniform

165
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:17,306
 convergence stated in the

166
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:18,190
 theorem.

167
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,986
 And maybe it's always good

168
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:21,586
 to visualize this convergence

169
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:22,402
 in a picture.

170
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:24,106
 So let's sketch the graph

171
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:25,750
 of the function S,

172
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,634
 and let's simply say that

173
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:29,482
 here on the x axis, we have

174
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:30,956
 the domain D.

175
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:32,864
 Hence, for example, the graph

176
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:34,488
 of S could look like

177
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:35,140
 this.

178
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,272
 And now what one can do is

179
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:38,768
 to look at such an epsilon

180
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:40,344
 tube around this

181
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:41,112
 graph.

182
00:04:41,296 --> 00:04:42,992
 And then the result is, no

183
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,448
 matter how small we choose

184
00:04:44,504 --> 00:04:46,384
 this epsilon, the graph

185
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:47,928
 of the partial sums

186
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:49,780
 always lies inside.

187
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,856
 Obviously, this only has

188
00:04:51,888 --> 00:04:53,520
 to hold eventually, which

189
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,200
 means n has to be big

190
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,820
 enough.

191
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,970
 So this is what you can remember.

192
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,466
 This is exactly what the

193
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:01,310
 uniform convergence means.

194
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,178
 Okay, then the next step

195
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:05,010
 would be to look at the proof

196
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,110
 of this statement.

197
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,146
 And in fact, it's surprisingly

198
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:08,706
 easy.

199
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:10,298
 We only need the so called

200
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:12,058
 Cauchy criterion for

201
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:12,710
 series.

202
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,482
 And you can find that in

203
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:16,378
 my real analysis course in

204
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:17,510
 part 17.

205
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,722
 And it simply tells us that

206
00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:20,754
 a series is

207
00:05:20,802 --> 00:05:22,790
 convergent if and only

208
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,534
 if the partial sums form

209
00:05:24,582 --> 00:05:26,410
 a Cauchy sequence.

210
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,134
 So you see, the Cauchy

211
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:29,726
 criterion simply

212
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:31,430
 uses the completeness of

213
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,446
 the real or complex numbers.

214
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,014
 Now, more precisely, this

215
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:36,510
 means that for all epsilon

216
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,350
 greater zero, we find an

217
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,854
 index capital N

218
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:41,406
 such that for all

219
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:43,250
 indices afterwards,

220
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,014
 and let's simply call them

221
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:46,462
 lowercase n and

222
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:48,376
 m, we have that

223
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:50,200
 the sum in the absolute value

224
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,020
 is less than epsilon,

225
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,040
 and the sum has to go from

226
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,688
 m to the index

227
00:05:55,864 --> 00:05:56,560
 n.

228
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,240
 So you could just say this

229
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,624
 partial sum is

230
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:00,944
 arbitrarily small

231
00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:02,020
 eventually.

232
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,168
 And now please recall, in

233
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:05,608
 the assumption of the theorem,

234
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:07,520
 we assumed that we have the

235
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,904
 convergence for the series

236
00:06:08,992 --> 00:06:10,960
 of Mk, which means

237
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,800
 we have the Cauchy criterion

238
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,788
 as well.

239
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:15,340
 Hence, for a given epsilon

240
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,204
 greater zero, we can choose

241
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,644
 a capital N as

242
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,620
 above, and then we immediately

243
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,468
 get a result for the series

244
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:24,492
 of the functions fk.

245
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:25,972
 So let's simply look at the

246
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:27,964
 partial sums from m to

247
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,076
 n as well.

248
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:30,644
 And then we can just use

249
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:32,252
 the standard triangle

250
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:33,240
 inequality.

251
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,508
 It's a finite sum, so we

252
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:36,796
 can just pull the absolute

253
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:37,960
 value inside.

254
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,596
 And then in the next step

255
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:41,588
 we can just estimate f

256
00:06:41,644 --> 00:06:43,360
 k of x inside.

257
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,308
 And now the assumption comes

258
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,092
 in that we know that each

259
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,028
 one is less or equal than

260
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:49,932
 Mk.

261
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:51,716
 However, for the series of

262
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:53,652
 the non negative Mk's,

263
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:55,524
 we already know it's less

264
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:57,204
 than epsilon by the Cauchy

265
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:58,120
 criterion.

266
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,924
 In other words, the Cauchy

267
00:06:59,972 --> 00:07:01,660
 criterion now also tells

268
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,636
 us that this series here

269
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,276
 is a convergent one,

270
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,188
 which already implies that

271
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:08,762
 the function S from above

272
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:10,798
 is a well defined function.

273
00:07:10,974 --> 00:07:12,894
 In other words, it exists

274
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:14,558
 and it makes sense to talk

275
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:15,342
 about it.

276
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:16,590
 And thats what we will do

277
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,494
 now, because we want to talk

278
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:20,326
 about the supremum norm

279
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:21,902
 more concretely, we want

280
00:07:21,926 --> 00:07:23,390
 to take the difference of

281
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,134
 S with the partial sums

282
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:26,830
 in the supremum norm.

283
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,286
 And exactly like before,

284
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:29,918
 lets fix an epsilon greater

285
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:31,446
 zero and lets choose the

286
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:33,198
 corresponding index capital

287
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:33,910
 N.

288
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,582
 And as always, the lowercase

289
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:37,350
 n should be greater or equal

290
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,050
 than this capital N.

291
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,806
 Now first, as a reminder,

292
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,566
 the supremum norm is given

293
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:43,862
 by the supremum.

294
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,542
 So instead of the norm, we

295
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,182
 can just write supremum

296
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:49,090
 over x in D.

297
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,766
 And then we just look at

298
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:52,566
 the absolute value of the

299
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,170
 value of the functions.

300
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,374
 In other words, we just put

301
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:57,918
 in x at the correct

302
00:07:57,974 --> 00:07:58,970
 positions.

303
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,118
 And then in the next step

304
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:02,638
 we can simply substitute

305
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:04,510
 s with the limit

306
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,370
 definition.

307
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,306
 This means instead of the

308
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:09,202
 infinity symbol here we can

309
00:08:09,226 --> 00:08:11,050
 just write limit of

310
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,310
 the partial sums.

311
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,474
 So maybe let's use a number

312
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,010
 m that goes to

313
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,830
 infinity.

314
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,674
 And now we can simply use

315
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:20,082
 that the absolute value is

316
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:21,930
 a continuous function, which

317
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,490
 means we can pull out the

318
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,258
 limit.

319
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:25,546
 So it's not a problem at

320
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:27,082
 all to write the limit in

321
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,870
 front of the absolute value.

322
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,002
 And then you should see inside

323
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,026
 the absolute value.

324
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:33,274
 It looks much simpler.

325
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:35,132
 Now we just subtract

326
00:08:35,196 --> 00:08:37,068
 finite sums so we know

327
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:38,920
 a finite sum remains.

328
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,884
 However, maybe it's not clear

329
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:42,564
 how to write this sum because

330
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:44,436
 we don't know if m or n is

331
00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:45,076
 bigger.

332
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:46,572
 But obviously in the case

333
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:48,500
 that m is bigger than n,

334
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,156
 we would say that k goes

335
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,732
 from n plus one to

336
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:52,400
 m.

337
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,148
 And of course, in the second

338
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:55,580
 case, we would just write

339
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,960
 it the other way around.

340
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,604
 It does not change so much,

341
00:08:58,652 --> 00:08:59,972
 because we know that for

342
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:01,740
 both cases, if n and

343
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,268
 m are bigger than the capital

344
00:09:03,364 --> 00:09:04,964
 N, then this whole

345
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,300
 sum is less than

346
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,172
 epsilon.

347
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:08,748
 This is simply the cauchy

348
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:10,468
 criterion we have at

349
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:11,920
 every point x.

350
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,380
 Hence, the conclusion is,

351
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,332
 even with the limit and with

352
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,308
 the supremum, we stay lower

353
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:19,160
 epsilon.

354
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,012
 The only thing we can lose

355
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:22,412
 here is the strict

356
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:23,400
 inequality.

357
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,172
 But obviously, this does

358
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:26,840
 not change anything, because

359
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,880
 epsilon was arbitrarily chosen

360
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,112
 from the beginning.

361
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:31,704
 And with that, we have it.

362
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:33,472
 This means that in the limit

363
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:35,272
 n to infinity, this

364
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:37,140
 norm here goes to zero.

365
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,120
 And since we have the supremum

366
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,840
 norm, this is exactly the

367
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,540
 uniform convergence.

368
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,664
 Therefore, this is already

369
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:45,980
 the whole proof.

370
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,744
 And then I would say, let's

371
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,392
 look at a nice application

372
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,040
 of this Weierstrass m

373
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,718
 test.

374
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:53,602
 So let's take an example

375
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,658
 of a series with a function

376
00:09:55,714 --> 00:09:56,586
 inside.

377
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:57,986
 And if you know something

378
00:09:58,058 --> 00:09:59,986
 about Fourier series, you

379
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:01,370
 might recognize that this

380
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,538
 one here is an important

381
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:03,226
 one.

382
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:05,146
 So let's take f k from

383
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:07,090
 R to R, where f

384
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,970
 k of x is

385
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,586
 given as the cosine

386
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:12,154
 of kx

387
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:13,790
 over k squared.

388
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,042
 So this is our function depending

389
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:16,746
 on k.

390
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:18,346
 And now we can look at the

391
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:19,430
 absolute value,

392
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,650
 and we know that the cosine

393
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,898
 is bounded by one.

394
00:10:22,994 --> 00:10:24,602
 So this is definitely less

395
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,602
 or equal than one over k

396
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,350
 squared.

397
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,458
 And this holds for every

398
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:30,978
 x in R.

399
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:32,570
 And now you only have to

400
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,250
 know that the series of one

401
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,674
 over k squared is

402
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,522
 convergent to apply the

403
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:39,202
 Weierstrass M test.

404
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:40,938
 And there are different possibilities

405
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:42,562
 to show this, but it's

406
00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:44,578
 definitely not too complicated.

407
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:46,650
 And a basic result you definitely

408
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,670
 should remember.

409
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,304
 And indeed, we can immediately

410
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:50,912
 make use of that with the

411
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:52,460
 Weierstrass M test.

412
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,800
 Our conclusion is that this

413
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,832
 series of functions is

414
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:58,832
 uniformly convergent.

415
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:00,288
 And indeed, this is really

416
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:01,640
 helpful as a result.

417
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,152
 For example, when you want

418
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:04,736
 to calculate the derivative

419
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:06,800
 of this function and

420
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,888
 something like that, you

421
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:09,600
 can find in my Fourier

422
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,980
 transform series.

423
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,864
 In fact, exactly.

424
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:14,792
 This result here plays a

425
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:16,220
 crucial role there.

426
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,152
 Okay, then, I think this

427
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:19,680
 is good enough for this video,

428
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,096
 and I really hope I meet

429
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:22,352
 you in another one.

430
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:23,784
 So, have a nice day, and

431
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:24,700
 bye bye.
